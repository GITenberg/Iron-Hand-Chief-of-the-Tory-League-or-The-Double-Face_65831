</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the colonists had acquired a mastery over the savages
of the wilderness, and assisted in breaking the French
power on their frontier, they began to feel their manhood
stirring within them, and they tacitly agreed no longer to
submit to the narrow and oppressive policy of Great Britain.
Their industry and commerce were too expansive to be confined
within the narrow limits of those restrictions which the
Board of Trade, from time to time, had imposed, and they
determined to cast off these chains. Moreover, the principles
of civil and religious liberty urged them on; and,
at last, the trumpet of the Revolution was sounded, as the
violent result of their dissatisfactions.</p>

<p>It was during the fourth year of this Revolution, in the
year of our Lord 1778, that our tale opens in the vicinity
of Lake George, near Fort Ann.</p>

<p>In a pretty, white cottage a short distance from the fort
sat two men over their wine, discussing the politics of the
day.</p>

<p>One, who is destined to be our hero, was about five and
twenty years of age; he was tall and commanding; his
features nicely molded and in perfect harmony; the eyes
were gray, although, at a distance, one might mistake them
for black, and his hair was dark-brown and curled close to
his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>Edgar Sherwood, for such was his name, was of English
birth. Another brother and he were the last of an aristocratic
family. These two had, however, some few years
previous, separated on account of a misunderstanding in regard
to their paternal acres. After the death of their father,
our hero inherited the greater part of the estate. This his
brother declared to be unjust, and had sworn he would have
satisfaction. Thus they parted.</p>

<p>Edgar had been treated perhaps a little unfairly by his
native country in some affairs, and becoming enraged against
her he had come to America to espouse the cause of the
struggling colonists.</p>

<p>The man with whom Edgar Sherwood was conversing was
the father of his betrothed; his name was Thomas Lear.
He was a native of England, and a thorough Tory.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible, young man, that you are so rash as to
think of joining the Continental army?” said Thomas Lear,
gazing at Edgar Sherwood with a look of astonishment, and
his face flushing to a deep crimson.</p>

<p>“It is, sir.”</p>

<p>“And have you no respect for your king, or love for your
family and friends?”</p>

<p>“For the former, none whatever, but for the latter a great
deal of love and respect.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, how can you go to work deliberately and
bring this disgrace upon them? Why, Sherwood, it is absurd
to think of doing such a thing!” and Lear began to
grow angry.</p>

<p>“If it is absurd to lend one’s aid to a righteous cause, then
I am willing to be called absurd or rash, but I am determined
to do this.”</p>

<p>“But, do you have faith in this war? Do you believe
these colonists will ever overcome King George?”</p>

<p>“Most assuredly they will!” replied Edgar Sherwood.
“Why, sir, they fight like tigers, and they never will remain
conquered. What arouses these men to arms is the love of
liberty, their firesides, their wives and children.”</p>

<p>“Very well; perhaps they are good at fighting, but, where
is the money coming from to maintain this war any longer?
Congress has none.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>“They will fight without pay; and, moreover, each soldier
will contribute his mite.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, they are but a handful at best, and can not
hold out much longer.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my good sir!” and Edgar Sherwood’s eyes sparkled
with enthusiasm, “do not be deceived in this. The colonists,
though few in number, have been compelled from the beginning
to be self-reliant, and have been made strong by their
mother’s neglect. Heretofore they have built fortifications,
raised armies, and fought battles for England’s glory and their
own preservation, without England’s aid and without her
sympathy; and, think you now they can not do this again,
with twofold zeal, for themselves?”</p>

<p>Thomas Lear was beginning to chafe under the young man’s
patriotic words, and perceiving that he could not persuade
him to abandon his purpose, he became very angry.</p>

<p>“I ask you once more, Sherwood,” said he, “to pause and
consider the consequences; think&mdash;I entreat you&mdash;of my
daughter, Imogene, before you take this rash step.”</p>

<p>“I have considered it all, sir, but my mind remains the
same.”</p>

<p>Lear grew deathly pale with rage at these last words.
Thomas Lear was a rich man, and he had long counted upon
having Edgar Sherwood for a son-in-law, but this could not
be under these circumstances. He dashed his wine-glass savagely
upon the table, and sprung to his feet.</p>

<p>“You are mad! stark mad!” he cried. “Henceforth our
connection is severed; never dare to cross my threshold again,
for you are a traitor to your king, sir&mdash;begone!”</p>

<p>Having uttered these words, the old man sunk back in his
chair perfectly exhausted.</p>

<p>At this moment, the door was suddenly thrown open, and
Imogene Lear&mdash;Edgar Sherwood’s betrothed&mdash;appeared upon
the scene.</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” she cried, casting herself at the feet of her
parent, “I implore you to have mercy! Recall your words&mdash;forgive!”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Lear.</p>

<p>“Be it so!” said Edgar Sherwood, scornfully, and was
gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>One month has passed away since the events last related,
and during this time Edgar Sherwood had become a captain
in the American army, and was stationed with his regiment
at Fort Ann.</p>

<p>It was a bright, clear morning in the month of September,
and a gentle breeze caused the flag of freedom to rise and fall
in graceful folds over the garrison, inspiring the heart of every
loyal man with patriotic fervor as he looked up to it.</p>

<p>Within the fort, every thing seemed in commotion, but
without, all was quiet, and an observer would never have surmised
that any thing particular was going on. The soldiers
were hurrying back and forth; and some were collected in
groups busily talking.</p>

<p>During the past night, the commander had received information
from one of his spies that the notorious band, called
the Tory League, led by their villainous chief, Iron Hand,
was preparing to attack the house of a prominent Whig, and
that it would be necessary to send a company or two of men
to secure the patriot’s safety.</p>

<p>The colonel had chosen Captain Sherwood to go on this
little expedition with his company, and the men were now
preparing for that purpose.</p>

<p>The Tory League was composed of Tories and Indians,
whom King George, foreseeing at the beginning of the war
would be valuable allies to him if but secured, sent over agents
to enlist in his cause. Among these agents came the man
who had made himself so notorious throughout the country
under the title of Iron Hand, which name the Indians gave
him. The villainous deeds of this band and their white chief
were countless, and they had become a terror to all stanch
Whigs.</p>

<p>A large reward had been offered for the capture of Iron
Hand, dead or alive, but to no profit; he was too artful for
his enemy. In fact, no one, as yet, in the Continental army
had been able even to obtain a sight of him. Search had
been made for the rendezvous of the band but without success.</p>

<p>The attacks of the Tory League were always made with so
much privacy as to exclude the sufferers, not only from succor,
but frequently, through a dread of future depredations, from
the commiseration of their neighbors also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>The soldiers received the orders to prepare for action with
delight; excitement of any kind had been scarce for the last
few months around the fort, and time dragged heavily on
with them. Captain Sherwood felt some pleasure also on being
chosen for this occasion, as he had had but little opportunity
to show his valor since his enlistment. Yet, all day long his
face wore a troubled look, and his whole manner seemed
changed from usual gayety to sadness. The few who had
observed this attributed it to fear, and yet could not believe
that such a man should even know the meaning of the word.</p>

<p>When evening came, and a few hours before he was to
start out upon his mission, he sat down, and, writing a short
note, dispatched it to the little white cottage on the hill.</p>

<p>Imogene Lear, on receiving her lover’s note, cast a shawl
about her delicate form, and hastened to the place appointed
for their meeting. It was in a thick grove of cedars a short
distance from the cottage.</p>

<p>Captain Sherwood, dressed in his long military cloak, with
his sword girded to his side, was pacing to and fro in a
thoughtful mood under the shadow of the stalwart trees.</p>

<p>“Edgar,” whispered Imogene, approaching with noiseless
steps behind him, and placing her little white hand upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Imogene? It is you!” said he, turning quickly and throwing
his arm around her waist. “I was afraid you would
be unable to come, my darling.”</p>

<p>“Father was asleep and I stole out unobserved, but I must
not remain long away, or he may awake and miss me.”</p>

<p>“Is he as savage against me as ever?” asked Edgar.</p>

<p>“Yes; but, do not let this trouble you, dear Edgar, I am
the same&mdash;as&mdash;ever.”</p>

<p>“I know you are, my darling,” and he imprinted a kiss
upon her cheek.</p>

<p>Imogene Lear was eighteen years of age. She was tall in
stature, and most exquisitely formed. Her skin was white,
even waxen white; and now and then a tinge of the rose
visited her cheek; her lips were of that ruby red which goes
with perfect health; perfectly arched brows, and long, dark
lashes, shading eyes of wonderful brilliancy and depth of
expression, made up this face suitable for an angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<p>“Let us sit down,” said Edgar, leading the way to a fallen
tree. “How are we to overcome this prejudice of your
father, Imogene?”</p>

<p>“I know not,” said she; “he is very angry with you, but
time may change him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he is right and I am wrong in this matter?”</p>

<p>Imogene colored and did not reply. Edgar saw this, and
dropping his head, said, sorrowfully:</p>

<p>“Then you think I am in the wrong?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! but you know&mdash;he&mdash;is my father.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know,” said Edgar, impatiently.</p>

<p>“There, dear Edgar, do not let us quarrel about this; of
course you are in the right.”</p>

<p>Then the couple remained silent for some time.</p>

<p>“We were to be married next month. Need this rupture
between your father and me make any difference?”</p>

<p>“You would not urge me to marry against his will?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Edgar, coldly.</p>

<p>“We can wait awhile and he may relent.”</p>

<p>“And pray how long will you wait for me?”</p>

<p>“All my lifetime, if need be!” and Imogene looked him
full in the face with her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>“And will you never forget, whatever may happen?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“My beautiful one, I believe you. Forgive me for asking
you to do wrong.”</p>

<p>“You said in your note, Edgar, that you were going away
to-night.”</p>

<p>The same troubled look that had haunted him all day now
again was plainly visible on Edgar Sherwood’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “but we return to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to battle?” asked Imogene, quickly, perceiving
this look. “Is there any thing serious about to happen?”</p>

<p>“No; why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because you seem troubled about something.”</p>

<p>“I am a little&mdash;shall I tell you why?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, dear Edgar, are we to have any secrets between
us?”</p>

<p>“But you will laugh at me if I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Try me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p>“Are you superstitious, Imogene?”</p>

<p>“No, not very.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is all about a strange dream that I had last night,
and you will say that I am superstitious if I tell it to you.”</p>

<p>“Come, now, do not delay any longer, but tell it to me at
once; my curiosity is excited.”</p>

<p>“It appeared to me as follows:</p>

<p>“I seemed to be walking by the side of a lake, when, suddenly,
a shriek, which fairly chilled my blood, filled the air,
and then I thought I saw you rush past me, dressed in white,
and crying, <em>help! help! help!</em></p>

<p>“Approaching the water you sprung into a canoe and
pushed far away from the shore. I could neither move nor
speak to you, and my agony was killing me. The canoe began
to float, I thought, bearing you with it. Then I was trying
to swim to you, when, in a moment, the boat mysteriously
disappeared. I was paralyzed, and looking down into the clear
water, I thought I saw you lying upon the bottom.</p>

<p>“At this moment some one behind me laughed&mdash;laughed
as only a fiend could laugh. Turning around, I thought I
saw my own image, and I started back a step. The apparition
approached, and pointing down at you, said: ‘Look, look,
this shall be your grave also! Beware of your shadow!’ and
then it vanished.</p>

<p>“I awoke. Cold perspiration stood in great beads upon
my forehead. You will tell me that I ought not to let this
trouble me, as it was only a dream; nevertheless, I can not
help it; it has taken a strong hold upon me, and I can not
shake it off.”</p>

<p>“It was strange,” mused Imogene. “I hope nothing will
happen to you, Edgar, for if I could hear that you were&mdash;well,
never mind what&mdash;I should die with grief.”</p>

<p>The couple now observed that there was a light in the
cottage.</p>

<p>“I must go now,” said Imogene, starting up, half-affrighted
lest her father should miss her.</p>

<p>“I will go part way with you,” and they moved away.</p>

<p>As they arrived near the house, they stopped a moment before
parting, and Edgar happened to cast a glance back to
the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>There, standing by a huge tree, where the moonlight fell
upon him, was the form of a man&mdash;a perfect copy in every
respect of Edgar Sherwood.</p>

<p>“Do you see it?” whispered Imogene, trembling and turning
ashy pale.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MURDERED MAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was near midnight when Captain Sherwood and his
men arrived in the vicinity of the Whig’s house. They had
miscalculated the distance from the fort, and were later than
was designed.</p>

<p>The Whig’s residence was one of the old-fashion farmhouses
common in those days, and on all sides of it was a
thick growth of foliage which, at a short distance, completely
hid it from view.</p>

<p>The soldiers marched in single file cautiously up the road
that led to the front of the house and halted. All was quiet
and dark around the place. Captain Sherwood advanced a
few steps and listened&mdash;the low, melancholy howl of a dog
broke the stillness. Then he approached the front door to
knock, but finding it open, entered.</p>

<p>The lower rooms of the house were dark and deserted; the
furniture was scattered about in great disorder. Again the
captain heard the howl of a dog which seemed to come from
over his head, and hastening up the stairs he entered one of
the upper rooms, where a horrid spectacle met his sight. There,
on the floor, lay an old man weltering in his blood&mdash;dead. His
body was horribly mangled and the scalp torn from his head.
A faithful Newfoundland dog was standing with his forepaws
upon the dead man’s breast, mourning over him.</p>

<p>Captain Sherwood turned away sick at heart, and darted
down the stairs back to his men.</p>

<p>“The villains have been here,” said he, “and sacked the
house. The old man lies dead upon the floor; the rest of the
family were probably taken prisoners. Let War-Cloud hunt
out their trail, for we must shoot every man of this gang.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<p>The soldiers were furious at this new outrage, and manifested
their willingness to follow the Tory League to the end
of the earth, for vengeance. In a few moments War-Cloud&mdash;the
scout&mdash;gave the signal that he had found the trail, and
the company started off in pursuit. Every foot of the ground
was familiar to the scout, and he had no difficulty in leading
the way.</p>

<p>All night long they hurried on in pursuit, over hills and
valleys, through woods, and across plains. The trees, clad
in their autumnal garb, looked like iron warriors in the
moonlight, and every now and then, as a slight wind whirled
the leaves to the ground, the troops would stop and listen for
their enemy.</p>

<p>The night wore on until the moon having completed her
course, left the land in darkness&mdash;but darkness not long to last,
for soon the orient heralded the approach of dawning day.</p>

<p>As the eastern horizon began to show these signs, the soldiers,
being fatigued, halted upon the summit of a high hill. Their
tramp had been a long one, but still there were no signs of the
Tory League save their trail, which they seemed to have taken
no pains to conceal. The League had undoubtedly got a good
start and were improving their advantage.</p>

<p>Captain Sherwood and War-Cloud withdrew a short distance
from the troops, to a cliff that jutted out from the general
line of the mountain. Here they could command a view
of an entire valley to the distance of many miles. It was
quite level and presented a beautiful scene. The surface was
covered with a carpet of bright green, enameled by flowers
that gleamed like many-colored gems, and here and there the
willow mingled its foliage in soft shady groves, forming inviting
retreats. A stream, like a silver serpent, bisected the
valley&mdash;not running in a straight course, but in luxuriant
windings, as though it loved to tarry in the midst of the bright
scene.</p>

<p>War-Cloud, after scanning the whole plain before him for
some time, turned to the captain with delight.</p>

<p>“Look, chief!” said he, pointing to that part of the valley
almost below them. “See! white and red devils right
there.”</p>

<p>Yes, there was the Tory League sure enough, quietly seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
upon the ground, enjoying their morning meal in full sight of
the captain.</p>

<p>It was a motley crowd, indeed. There were white men
dressed in British uniforms and others merely in loose hunting-shirts
and breeches, together with the dusky savages who
were in full war-costume&mdash;that is, naked to the waist, and
painted over the breast and face so as to render them as frightful
as possible. Their heads were closely shaven over the
temples and behind the ears&mdash;a patch upon the top was
cropped short, but in the center of the crown, one long lock
of hair remained uncut, which was intermingled with plumes
and plaited so as to hang down the back.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said the captain, “this is but a small part of the
Tory League, for there are hardly more than seventy-five men
here, and the band is said to number two or three hundred.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make the snakes these many less!” said the scout.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll give the villains their deserts in a short space
of time; but where are the prisoners?” exclaimed the captain,
glancing searchingly over the band.</p>

<p>“There!” said War-Cloud, his practiced eye observing
them at once, seated beneath the shade of a willow tree.
“Three women.”</p>

<p>“To their rescue at once!” cried the captain, dashing away
to his company. “Up, up, every man of you, and follow
me!”</p>

<p>The path that led from the cliff to the valley was nearly
half a mile in length before it reached the level below, winding
through a growth of young trees which completely hid
the soldiers from view.</p>

<p>Down, down the mountain’s side they hurried faster and
faster, until at length they burst forth upon the open plain
within a few hundred yards of the enemy.</p>

<p>“Now, my brave fellows!” shouted Captain Sherwood,
wielding his sword above his head, “teach these British villains
and red rascals decency!” and away the whole troop
rushed wildly upon the foe.</p>

<p>This was a surprise to the Tories and Indians, and a general
panic seized upon them. Unmindful of every thing but
their own safety, they took to flight, leaving their prisoners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
But, after fleeing a short distance, and finding themselves hard
pressed by their foe, they turned about like hunted game at
bay to give battle.</p>

<p>But a moment elapsed, and full two hundred men were engaged
in deadly conflict.</p>

<p>Crack&mdash;crack&mdash;crack, went the rifles, and a sulphury smoke
spread a cloud upon the air. As the vapory mass cleared
away, some were seen dashing at each other with their empty
guns, some twanging their bows from a distance, and others
grappling in hand-to-hand combat.</p>

<p>Neither bugle nor drum sent forth its inspiring notes; no
cannon rolled its thunder; no rocket blazed; but every now
and then the wild war-whoop rung out upon the air, making
the blood of the listener run cold. And then came the fierce
charging cheer of the troops, and the cries of triumph and
vengeance.</p>

<p>While the fight was raging, War-Cloud, observing two Indians
making for their prisoners, lashed under the willow tree,
uttered the war-cry and started after them at full speed. The
savages looked behind them, and seeing but one adversary,
gave fight. War-Cloud whirled his tomahawk at the foremost
one’s head, but the savage with a quick movement
evaded the weapon and sprung forward with his knife. Then
there was a desperate struggle of life and death. The bodies
of the combatants seemed twined around each other; then
one of them fell heavily to the ground. War-Cloud’s antagonist
had fallen. But before the scout could whirl about, the
other Indian&mdash;an active warrior&mdash;rushed upon him and bore
him down. His knee was pressed on War-Cloud’s breast, and
his arm raised on high to drive the deadly blade into his
heart! but at this instant Captain Sherwood’s trusty rifle
sounded on the air&mdash;the savage dropped dead, and the scout
was saved.</p>

<p>At length, after an hour of hard fighting, the Tories were
completely routed; and but few ever lived to tell the tale of
their disaster. After the excitement was over, and while the
soldiers were looking after their dead and wounded, the white
captives, who had been silent observers of the fray, were released
from their fetters. Their joy was great at being restored
to liberty again, but their grief was greater for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
murdered father. The story of the captives was to this effect:</p>

<p>At an early hour in the evening, and while the old man
and his three daughters were gathered round their fireside
chatting, their Newfoundland dog sprung to his feet and rushed
toward the door, growling fiercely.</p>

<p>His growl shortly increased to a bark&mdash;so earnest, that it
was evident some one was outside. The door was shut and
barred; but the old man, thinking perhaps it might be the
soldiers whom he expected, pulled out the bar, and opened
the door without inquiring.</p>

<p>He had scarcely shown himself, when the wild whoops of
Indians rung on their ears, and a blow from a heavy club prostrated
him upon the threshold. In spite of the terrible onset
of the brave dog, the savages, white and red, rushed into the
house yelling fearfully, and brandishing their weapons. In
less than five minutes the house was plundered of every
valuable article. The old man, partly recovering, had seized
his gun and mounted the stairs, where he was met and butchered
outright. When the marauders had finished plundering,
they seized their prisoners and made off in haste.</p>

<p>Such was the tale of the three females.</p>

<p>The soldiers were soon collected into ranks, and were ready
for marching orders. They had been triumphant, and were
in good spirits. Nearly every man of their foe lay dead or
dying upon the field, while they had lost but three men and
only five wounded. However, in the midst of their exultations,
a murmur ran through the crowd, and every man looked
at his companion inquiringly. “What had become of their
brave leader, Captain Sherwood?” each asked, in a whisper.
He had disappeared from their midst.</p>

<p>An hour was spent in search for him; the valley and surrounding
woods were scoured in vain, for he was not found.
The troops were obliged to turn their steps homeward without
him. It was nearly evening when they arrived at the fort,
where they were hailed with loud shouts from their comrades
when the news of victory was proclaimed. But, afterward,
when it was found that the captain was missing, a shade of
sadness seemed to fall on all. Immediately scouts were sent
in all directions to search for him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III"><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER III</span>.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE STRANGE FACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ladies of the garrison for some time had been suffering
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ennui</i>, and after holding a consultation, they resolved to
petition for some change to break the monotonous life. Accordingly,
when all their feminine forces were brought to bear
upon the officers, they forthwith yielded, and it was determined
that the following night&mdash;the night after the soldiers’
return&mdash;should be a gala occasion; a night devoted to Terpsichore.</p>

<p>The ladies set to work with an ardent zeal, decorating the
hall where the ball was to be held. It was a long barracks
used for the officers’ mess-room. The regimental flags were
placed here and there about the room, and foliage, brought
from the woods, ornamented the walls, so that in a short time
the place had assumed quite a festive appearance.</p>

<p>During the afternoon of this day, and while everybody in
the fort seemed to be talking about him, Captain Sherwood
made his appearance. He was pale, and looked fatigued; his
uniform showed marks of hard usage, being badly torn and
bespattered with blood.</p>

<p>An eager crowd was soon collected around him to listen to
his exploits. All were greatly surprised upon learning that
he had not been taken prisoner as was supposed. His story
was as follows:</p>

<p>During the battle he had come in hand-to-hand combat
with an Indian who appeared to be the leader of the Tory
party, as Iron Hand himself was not with them. He finally
managed, after a hard contest, to wound the arm of his antagonist,
whereupon the savage turned about and took to
flight. The captain hotly pursued, and in a few moments,
both were separated from the main body of the combatants in
a secluded portion of the woods; however, the officer was
fast gaining ground on the Indian, and in a few moments
would have had him in his power, when suddenly he received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
a shot from some unseen foe. Staggering forward he fell, and
this was the last he remembered.</p>

<p>He had fainted, and when he recovered, he found himself
prone in a hole in the earth about four or five feet deep, with
a heap of hemlock boughs covering the top. The dirt had
been just thrown out, and whoever had dug the hole had undoubtedly
intended it for his grave. But they probably had
been frightened away, and consequently left their work only
half accomplished.</p>

<p>When the captain had thoroughly revived, and became
aware of his situation, he managed to crawl out of the horrid
place and drag himself to a stream near by, where he
quaffed a draught which started his blood on the regular course
again and restored vitality.</p>

<p>After bathing a wound in his leg&mdash;which was not serious,
as the ball had merely cut the flesh&mdash;and bandaging it up with
his handkerchief, he started for the garrison, where he had
arrived, weak and exhausted from loss of blood and want of
food.</p>

<p>Every attention was now paid to him, for Captain Sherwood
had become a great favorite with all since his first entering
the fort. The surgeon was summoned immediately to dress
his wound, and the cooks of the garrison vied with each other
in serving up their best dish for the gallant officer in the
quickest possible time. The ladies offered their services
also, but the captain declared that he would not have any
thing more done for him. He was as well as any of them,
he said, having partaken of a good dinner, and to prove this,
he marched to the mess-room and spent the remainder of the
afternoon in assisting the fair ones arranging the hall for the
evening entertainment.</p>

<p>And now, dear reader, while our hero is there amusing himself,
let us transport ourselves from the fort to a pretty, white
cottage, which stands half-way down the side of a large hill
three miles in the distance.</p>

<p>It was near sunset. A sunset more brilliant than common.
The western sky was filled with masses of colored clouds, on
which gold and purple and blue mingled together in gorgeous
magnificence; and in which the eye of the beholder could
not fail to note the outlines of strange forms, and fancy them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
bright and glorious beings of another world. It was a picture
to gladden the eye, to give joy to the heart that was sad,
and make happier the happy.</p>

<p>All this beauty was not unobserved. Eyes were dwelling
upon it&mdash;beautiful eyes&mdash;and yet there was a sadness in their
look, that ill-accorded with the picture on which they were
gazing. Though apparently regarding the sunset, the thoughts
which gave them expression were drawn from a far different
source. The heart within was dwelling upon another object.</p>

<p>The owner of those eyes was a beautiful girl, or rather a
fully-developed woman. She was tall and majestic, of soft
graces and waving outlines. The lady was Imogene Lear.
She was walking backward and forward in a little garden at
the back of the house, as if waiting for the arrival of some one.</p>

<p>Every now and then her eyes sought the grove of cedars
at the foot of the inclosure, through whose slender trunks
gleamed the silvery surface of a stream. Upon this spot they
rested from time to time, with an expression of strange interest.
No wonder that to those eyes that was an interesting
spot&mdash;it was there where love’s first vows had been uttered
and two young hearts plighted forever.</p>

<p>Often as she gazed at this place a look of sadness would
steal over her face as if some thought were flying through
her brain that was unpleasant, and it brought with it clouds
upon her brow, and imparted an air of uneasiness. What
was that thought?</p>

<p>Ah! a stern father caused it. No longer could she meet
that lover, who had rendered this grove sacred, openly as in
former times, but was obliged to resort to deceit and have
their interviews in secret.</p>

<p>Sometimes she had been half tempted to forsake her home
and go with Edgar Sherwood. But no, she could not do
that; sober thought always brought her back to reason, and
she would determine again to stay by him and tend him in
his old age, for she was his only child and comfort, and then
before this trouble he had ever been very kind to her and
undoubtedly, ere long, he would relent and give his consent
to her marriage with Edgar.</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts she consoled herself with.</p>

<p>Imogene Lear was naturally open and frank, and the deceit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
which she now practiced on her father was something
altogether new and foreign to her noble nature, and it troubled
her exceedingly, but then her love for Edgar Sherwood
was strong, and love prevailed over conscience.</p>

<p>While continuing her walk up and down the garden path
she stopped short, as if having taken some sudden resolution.</p>

<p>“I will go&mdash;I ought to gratify him!” she muttered to herself.
Sitting down upon a bench near by, and opening a
folded slip of paper, she read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Imogene</span>&mdash;I have just returned from the war-path safe,
and wish to see you very much. We are to have a ball at the
garrison to-night. You must come&mdash;do not refuse, dearest one.
If you do I shall be miserable all the evening. As soon as your
father has retired for the night, hasten to our old place of meeting
with your brave steed, where I shall be in waiting. Adieu, my
dearest, for a few hours.</p>

<p class="right">E.”</p>
</div>

<p>When she had finished reading the note, she pressed it to
her lips and kissed it fervently.</p>

<p>“No, Edgar, I will not refuse: I will go!” she murmured,
and thrusting the letter into her bosom, she glided softly into
the house.</p>

<p>A few hours after sunset, and when it was dark, Imogene
again stole forth into the garden. This time she was closely
muffled in an ample cloak and her head was donned with a
riding-hat.</p>

<p>After proceeding a short distance she stopped and listened.
Perfect stillness reigned around the cottage. Then there
came a low whistle from the lower end of the garden, and
she tripped along over the sanded walk to the place, on
reaching which she called:</p>

<p>“Jeff?”</p>

<p>“Here, lady,” answered a man, stepping a little more into
the light. He was her trusty servant.</p>

<p>“All saddled?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Imogene.”</p>

<p>“Is <em>he</em> here?”</p>

<p>“Out there on the road waiting.”</p>

<p>The man assisted his mistress to mount, and the next moment,
giving her steed a tap with her whip, she dashed away
to meet her lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>As Edgar and Imogene met, their eyes sparkled with the
thought of love, but neither gave utterance to their thoughts
until their horses had borne them away from the cottage.
Edgar was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Were you intending to ride over to the garrison to-night,
Imogene?” he said.</p>

<p>“No, not until I received your note.”</p>

<p>“My note?” and Edgar looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why, Imogene, I sent you no note.”</p>

<p>“I have got it in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it.”</p>

<p>She handed the note to him which she had received, and
he ran his eye over the contents.</p>

<p>He looked astonished.</p>

<p>“By Heavens!” he exclaimed, “somebody is plotting against
us; but, thank God, I was in time to frustrate their plan!”</p>

<p>“Then you really did not write it?” and Imogene appeared
frightened.</p>

<p>“I never saw this note before&mdash;I did not even know you were
going to the fort until I met your servant on the edge of the
grove, who said you would be ready in a few moments, and
then hastened away before I could speak to him.”</p>

<p>“Who could have done this? Oh, Edgar, I fear there is some
dreadful mystery about this!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Imogene! there is nothing of the kind,” he said,
observing her alarm; “do not let this frighten you. Undoubtedly
some one of your servants did this with no good design,
but he will not dare try the same trick again.”</p>

<p>Here a new thought seemed to enter Imogene’s brain and
she asked, quickly:</p>

<p>“Your dream, Edgar? has any thing come from it?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied he, forcing a laugh; “how foolish I was to
let a silly dream trouble me!”</p>

<p>“I am very glad; it annoyed me much.”</p>

<p>“Let it be forgotten, dearest, for it was nothing more than
a common dream, although at the time I was quite certain it
was a vision&mdash;a presentiment.”</p>

<p>They were now entering a straggling patch of woods, which
stood at either side of the road but a short distance from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
fort. Imogene was about to speak again, when her quick ears
caught a sound that appeared odd to her. It was but a slight
rustling among the autumnal leaves that were lying in heaps
along the roadside, and might have been caused by the wind
had there been any, but not a breath was stirring. Something
else had caused it. What could it be?</p>

<p>Edgar and Imogene turned their heads simultaneously and
looked behind. At the same moment each caught a glance
of the face and form they had seen a few nights previous in
the grove near the cottage&mdash;the face that Edgar had declared
he had seen in his dream! There it stood in the middle of
the road, wrapped in a white, shaggy cloak, which gave the
mysterious form a frightful appearance, and the face, pale and
motionless, gazing after them.</p>

<p>In a moment it had disappeared, and Edgar and Imogene
each drew a long breath. Captain Edgar Sherwood was no
coward&mdash;was a brave man, and had often stood face to face
with death; but this was an apparition, something mysterious
which he could not understand. His lips grew white, and
the perspiration leaped into drops upon his forehead. He was
about to turn his horse’s head and ride back to where the
specter had stood, but Imogene was very much agitated, and
urged him forward to the fort.</p>

<p>Around the entrance of the garrison a large crowd of soldiers
were collected, to observe the guests as they arrived, and
when Edgar and Imogene passed through the men gave them
a loud and hearty cheer. This seemed to awaken the couple
from the lethargy into which they had fallen after beholding
the apparition.</p>

<p>Dismounting, they hurried to the ball-room, where they
found a gay assembly. The hall was brilliantly lighted
and handsomely decorated. The music, which consisted of
the regimental band, was playing a waltz, while a throng of
dancers whirled round the room.</p>

<p>There was a large number of persons present, composed of
the officers and their ladies, and the patriots dwelling in the
neighborhood. It was a merry company, and one that seemed
to dispel all troubles from the minds of our hero and heroine.</p>

<p>Imogene had hardly entered the room before she became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the center of attraction. The captain led her to the upper
end of the room, where they joined Colonel Hall, the commander
of the garrison, and his lady.</p>

<p>Now it was that the wound in his leg annoyed the captain,
for it kept him from engaging in the dance with Imogene. In
order to keep the knowledge of this from her, he was obliged
to find a partner for her among the lieutenants. A lucky accident
for them, and the fortunate one appreciated it, too.</p>

<p>While the dance was going on, and when the company
seemed in the hight of enjoyment, a man dressed in the garb
of a hunter, entered the hall, and forced his way to the colonel.
It was a noted American spy, Hank Putney by name, who had
been dispatched the day previous to search for Captain Sherwood.
He whispered a few words to the commander, and
both retired from the room together, but so quietly that no
one perceived them.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the hall, they directed their steps to the colonel’s
head-quarters, where the following conversation took
place between them:</p>

<p>“You say that you have news of importance, Putney?”
said the colonel, handing the scout a seat.</p>

<p>“Indeed, very important, colonel,” answered Putney, taking
a folded paper from his pocket and laying it upon the table.
“If ye’ll just run yer eye over that, perhaps ye’ll understand
what it is.”</p>

<p>Colonel Hall took up the paper, and with some difficulty
managed to read the poorly-written and badly-spelled document.
It was a description of the notorious Iron Hand.</p>

<p>“Well, really, this is good news, Putney. How did you
succeed in obtaining a sight of him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, easy enough! The band forgot to cover their trail
this time, and I tracked ’em. But look ye again at th’ paper.
Do ye not know him? You’ve seen him a hundred times.”</p>

<p>The colonel read the description over again carefully, then
paused for a moment in thought.</p>

<p>“There is a man in the garrison,” said he, “who answers
to this description, but then of course we should be mad to
think it meant Captain Edgar Sherwood!”</p>

<p>“I thought ye’d know him!” said Putney, and his eye
twinkled with satisfaction. “No madness about it, colonel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
He’s the man&mdash;this villain Iron Hand and our cap’n are
one!”</p>

<p>“Why, man, it is impossible!” cried the colonel, starting
to his feet, with astonishment. “What! Sherwood a British
spy! No, no, no!”</p>

<p>“Sartin, sir, sartin! Bill Hawkins and I saw him in their
camp yesterday, and he war their leader. I took down his
description, and we’ll sw’ar to it.”</p>

<p>Colonel Hall paced up and down the floor in great agitation.
Every little circumstance which had taken place
during the past few days again appeared to him, but in a
changed form. After a few moments’ thought, he was obliged
to admit that some things had transpired which looked
suspicious. Sherwood’s story about being nearly buried,
might be only a fabulous invention gotten up to cloak his
real actions, and the wound, perchance, he may have received
in the fray.</p>

<p>It also occurred to him now, that Sherwood, during the past
month, had been frequently absent from the fort, sometimes
for a day and night together. Then, again, the father of his
betrothed, Thomas Lear, was known to be a stanch Tory,
and although it was reported that Sherwood and he had quarreled
when the former entered the American army, yet this
might have been done for the purpose of carrying out their
deception.</p>

<p>“I suspect that’s why the cap’n was late with th’ soldiers
th’ night th’ Tories attacked the Whig’s house, ’cause he war
waitin’ for ’em to finish th’ job,” said Putney, adding additional
fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” exclaimed the colonel, stopping short in
his walk. “Have we all been blinded by this villain? Can
it really be that Sherwood is a traitor?”</p>

<p>“He’s Iron Hand, I’m sure o’ that!” again added Putney.</p>

<p>“Well, man,” Colonel Hall turned about so as to face the
scout, “I shall have him arrested at once, but if it turns out
that the charge is false, you shall be punished in his stead.
Now I ask you once more, are you sure he is the man?”</p>

<p>Putney turned very pale, but answered:</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>The colonel then dispatched him for an officer. In a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
time, guards began to appear at the different places of ingress
and exit to the ball-room. The assembly noticed this and
the dance stopped suddenly. A sergeant entered the room,
and informed Captain Sherwood that the colonel requested his
presence. The company stood still with astonishment. What
had happened&mdash;were the British approaching?</p>

<p>In a moment the news spread like wild-fire in the assembly,
that Captain Edgar Sherwood was arrested, and imprisoned
on a charge of being the Tory chieftain, Iron Hand,
and a British spy! At this announcement, a loud shriek burst
forth from the upper end of the room, and Imogene Lear sunk
fainting to the floor.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE NIGHT RIDE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night had turned out dark and drear, and the lowering
clouds denoted the approach of a storm. The last echo
of the booming gun had scarcely died away, warning the inmates
of the fort that it was time for all unnecessary lights to
be extinguished, and for all nightly revels to cease.</p>

<p>The shrill cry of the sentinel’s “All’s well” had passed
from mouth to mouth, denoting the security of the hour, and
the non-apprehension of an attack. The lights in the different
quarters were gradually extinguished, showing a reluctance
of the occupants to abandon their evening amusements.</p>

<p>As the last glimmer died away, the battlements of the fort
were wrapped in an almost impenetrable gloom. Nothing
broke the deathlike stillness, save the measured tread of the
guard as he walked his lonely post, or the hooting of the
owl, as it rung upon the silence of the night from the depth
of the neighboring forest.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the postern gates opposite the residence
of the commandant was thrown open, from which issued a
flood of light, making the surrounding darkness more intense,
and revealing a small group of officers and ladies, on the
countenances of whom were depicted gloom and sadness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
caused by the extraordinary and unlooked-for proceedings of
the earlier part of the evening. They had just emerged from
their dwelling to witness the departure of Miss Lear, after
having made ineffectual efforts to induce her to postpone her
journey till morning.</p>

<p>Imogene, wrapped in a heavy military cloak, and leaning
upon the arm of the garrison commander, followed by the
rest of the company, moved toward her steed, which, in charge
of one of the soldiers, stood outside of the gate, champing
his bit and pawing the ground impatiently.</p>

<p>Refusing all proffered assistance, she leaped gayly into the
saddle, and tried, by assuming a more genial appearance which
ill-bespoke the agony that wrung her heart, to banish the
thoughts that clouded the brows and dampened the feelings
of all present.</p>

<p>Her horse, a noble animal of coal-black color, long, flowing
tail and mane, with limbs of most delicate proportions, and
whose general symmetry of form defied the criticism of the
most observant, and denoted a capability of excessive endurance,
feeling again his accustomed burden, seemed to partake
of the happier moments of his mistress, and commenced to
curvet and gambol about to the extreme annoyance of his
attendant.</p>

<p>After portraying to Imogene the numerous dangers that
might befall her on the road, Colonel Hall made an urgent
but fruitless appeal to her to remain at the fort during the
night, or else to accept of an escort to her father’s house.
With an ill-affected smile, Imogene tried to allay the apprehensions
of her friends by making light of them, then waving
a parting farewell to the assembled company, in a few moments
afterward she was buried in the gloom.</p>

<p>The assemblage waited until the rattling of her horse’s
hoofs had died away in the distance, then slowly returned to
the apartment which they had left a few minutes previous.
Each member of the assembly seemed deeply engaged with
his own respective thoughts, the uppermost of which was, no
doubt, the surprising scenes that had transpired during the
evening.</p>

<p>The silence was finally broken by Colonel Hall, who had
been for several moments seemingly absorbed in a deep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
meditative mood, turning abruptly toward a young officer,
who, in a fit of abstraction, was standing with one arm leaning
on the mantel, whom he addressed as follows:</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Mansfield, I have resolved to dispatch a
body of horse to follow the direction taken by Miss Lear, in
case she should be molested, as I have apprehensions of the
safety of the route which she must traverse, for you are aware
that it is only a few days ago that those three Tory spies, now
immured in the bastion, were captured in the vicinity of her
father’s residence. Should it be agreeable, I will give the
command of the troops to you; but remember, the matter is
optional.”</p>

<p>“Colonel, I am at your service, and nothing would be more
pleasing to me than to be the protector of virtue, and if possible,
in the performance of my duty, to rid the country of
some of those bloodthirsty desperadoes that are such a scourge
to society.”</p>

<p>“Those are soldierly sentiments, lieutenant,” answered Colonel
Hall.</p>

<p>“The sentiments of the entire garrison,” responded the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I am pleased to learn that such chivalrous feelings pervade
the breasts of the men under my command,” said the
colonel; “however, lieutenant, as the time passes rapidly by,
and several minutes have already elapsed since the departure
of Miss Lear, it would be well to make preparations as speedily
as possible.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant making a low bow, retired to perform the
wishes of his commander. In a moment afterward, the
troopers, armed to the teeth, and mounted on their caparisoned
chargers, looking like so many grim specters, dashed through
the open gate and were soon lost to view. The gate creaked
on its rusty hinges as it swung back into its customary place,
and silence again reigned supreme.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V"><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER V</span>.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE RED WITNESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Imogene</span>, after her departure from the fort, sped rapidly
onward, heedless of the extended branches and immense
brambles that threatened every moment to drag her from her
saddle. Collecting her confused thoughts, which were exceedingly
harassed by her multiplied troubles, she checked the
impetuosity of her steed, and compelling him to assume a
more moderate gait, fell into a revery.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible,” she murmured, “that Colonel Hall
could have had any intimation of impending danger? he
seemed to persist so strongly that I should remain in the
fort till daylight!” Immediately recovering herself, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“A truce to such thoughts! It is only the wandering
of my disordered imagination, that turns every harmless tree
into a robber, and every neighboring bush into the lurking-place
of some concealed assassin. However, I must confess
that when I first entered the forest, an indescribable feeling
of dread seemed to chill my very blood; but I must scout
such ideas, which if I do not, they will entirely unnerve me,
and render me unfit to enter the presence of my father, who
must not receive from me even the slightest suspicion of Edgar’s
misfortune.”</p>

<p>In vain did she endeavor to shake off the gloomy feeling
that possessed her. The moon, which had been concealed
during the earlier part of the evening behind the immense
banks of clouds that had obscured the heavens, now became
occasionally visible, and its fitful beams served only to render
the intense darkness of the woods more apparent, and
lend a more spectral appearance to surrounding objects.</p>

<p>Imogene, having relapsed into her former mood, rode
slowly along the well-beaten path, unmindful of the cold,
keen wind that swept through the surging forest, causing the
stanch old oaks to gently bend their hoary tops to the
blast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p>The deep baying of her father’s hounds awakened her, at
length, from her musings. Congratulating herself upon having
reached the terminus of her journey in safety, she tried
to smile at the absurd fears of her friends, when her steed,
with a snort of terror, made a sudden pause, throwing himself
back on his haunches, almost unseating his mistress.</p>

<p>Imogene peered into the darkness beyond, but in consequence
of the intensity of the gloom, was unable to ascertain
the cause of her horse’s fear, and vainly endeavored to
urge her trembling animal forward, at first, by gentle applications
of the whip, and finally by kind words and caresses,
but with like success. It was with the utmost difficulty
that she succeeded in calming his excitement, and preventing
him from dashing headlong into the surrounding
woods.</p>

<p>At that moment, the moon, which had been hidden for a
short time by a passing cloud, again burst forth, lighting up
the surrounding darkness, and by the aid of the few faint
beams that struggled through the dense foliage overhead,
Imogene perceived a man at a few yards distant, standing
on the side of the road, partly concealed behind a tree.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was discovered, he stepped into the middle
of the path, as if he desired to speak. He appeared to be
advanced in years, with long, flowing, silvery locks, and
with little or no beard. His frame was still strong and sinewy,
though somewhat bent, apparently both by age and toil.
His countenance, however, bore but few traces of either age
or suffering, and had quite a prepossessing look, were it not for
the expression of his eyes, which were cold and repelling,
but with a glance sharp and piercing that seemed to read the
inmost secrets of any object on which it was cast.</p>

<p>These organs were nearly concealed by a pair of black,
shaggy brows, that ill-accorded with the excessive whiteness
of their owner’s hair. The stranger, noticing the anxious
and half-affrighted look of Imogene, broke the silence by saying:</p>

<p>“Young lady, be not afraid; I am but a poor, harmless
old man who has been traveling nearly the entire day over
hill and dale, and am only seeking some fit habitation where
I may rest my weary limbs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>Imogene gazed upon the singular being before her, for
some moments in silence, unable to utter a word, so sudden
was the shock of his unexpected appearance. Recovering
herself at length, she replied:</p>

<p>“For what reason, my good sir, are you, at such an hour
in a place so isolated. Do you not fear any danger?”</p>

<p>“I entered these woods to seek shelter from the impending
storm which threatened to take place during the earlier
part of the evening,” he answered. “As for danger, why
should I fear? Who would think of injuring a harmless
old man like me? No, no, these freebooters of the road
look for higher game than I, in my poverty, could offer!”</p>

<p>These last words were uttered in such a sarcastic tone that
Imogene, who had been adjusting her horse’s bridle, looked up
with astonishment and bent her penetrating gaze upon the
speaker, but seeing his harmless and abject appearance, her features
relaxed and softened into a look of pity.</p>

<p>Desiring to terminate the conversation, she said:</p>

<p>“My friend, these woods are not a suitable spot for either
of us, and as you remarked that you were seeking for a place
of shelter and safety, I will direct you where your wishes
will be gratified. Follow this path, without deviating either
to the right or left, and you will reach the habitation of my
father, where you will find a place to rest yourself. Lead on,
I will follow.”</p>

<p>Up to this moment, the stranger had not moved from the
position he had first assumed; but seeing the intention of
Imogene to proceed, he drew back a step and raised his hand,
motioning her to stop. She did as he requested.</p>

<p>“Before I accept your kind invitation,” continued the old
man, “I would wish to know, good lady, to whose generosity
I am indebted; whether it be friend or foe.”</p>

<p>“That matters not,” replied Imogene; “it is sufficient that
you are homeless and in want. I consider not whether the
recipient of my charity be friend or enemy, neither do I care.
You seek assistance, and that assistance I offer you&mdash;what
more is necessary? I am not your enemy, nor do I bear hostile
feeling to anybody. Let this answer suffice.”</p>

<p>The energy with which Imogene uttered these words
caused the rich blood to suffuse her countenance, which lent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
an additional charm to her excessive beauty. The stranger
sent an admiring look upon the beautiful young girl, but it
passed like a flash as he resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>“Young lady, pray forgive my hesitancy; but, as you are
aware, in these troublesome times a man is at a loss to know
whom to trust, and I am afraid that should I fall into the
hands of some, I might receive a reception disagreeable to my
nature,” at this he turned an inquisitive look upon his companion,
as if he sought to elicit a reply to his somewhat
equivocal answer.</p>

<p>“You doubt, then, the honesty of my hospitable offers,”
returned Imogene, with some animation.</p>

<p>“No, no, young lady; you misconstrue my meaning. I
doubt not your upright intentions; but, as I said before, you
know a person can not be too scrupulous in these matters.”</p>

<p>“In order not to deprive you of the comforts which you
seem to need, I will endeavor to dispel your ungrounded fears
by giving you the requisite information. The house to which
I have directed you is the residence of Thomas Lear,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>At the last-mentioned name, the stranger started back with
a look of surprise.</p>

<p>“Then you are Imogene, the daughter of old Lear, the
Tory?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>These words were uttered in a much different key. A
strong, manly voice had taken the place of the weak, wheezing
tone of the old man. The hot blood mantled the brow
of Imogene, as she quickly retorted to this seemingly insulting
language:</p>

<p>“Though Thomas Lear should be a supporter of the king’s
cause, his daughter, at least, should be free from insult. He
is my father, and I wish not to hear his name spoken of in so
wanton and disrespectful a manner. I have directed you to a
harbor of safety, where you may find a place of rest, and provide
for your wants. If you wish to avail yourself of my offer
you may do so, but you must use your own discretion in the
matter. I have already tarried too long&mdash;I must depart.”</p>

<p>“A word with you, Miss Lear, for such you have acknowledged
yourself to be, before you go,” replied the stranger;
and drawing nearer to Imogene, he whispered, in a subdued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
undertone, a few words which seemed to make her recoil with
an expression of horror.</p>

<p>“Away, vile wretch! Is it thus you would repay my kindness?
Begone!” She cast upon him such a look of disgust
and contempt that he seemed to writhe under her stinging rebuff.</p>

<p>“You reject, then, my offer?” he replied.</p>

<p>“I refuse to parley with such a despicable creature. Make
way; I must leave this spot.”</p>

<p>“Not quite so fast, young lady. I wish to allow you a
moment to reconsider your decision,” returned the old man
without moving from his position in the center of the path.</p>

<p>“You have heard my answer.”</p>

<p>“You persist in your refusal?</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>The stranger gave a low, short whistle, and immediately
disappeared in the brushwood. Before Imogene could recover
from her surprise at this sudden disappearance, her horse’s
bridle was seized by an armed ruffian, while two others confronted
her with drawn weapons. Imogene was immediately
alive to the danger that threatened her.</p>

<p>“What means this outrage&mdash;this detention?” she exclaimed
in an excited manner.</p>

<p>“It means,” returned one of the party, who appeared to
be the leader, in a gruff voice, “that you’re our prisoner.”</p>

<p>At this juncture one of the men raised his hand as a signal
for all to remain silent. In an instant every one assumed a
listening attitude, intent on catching the slightest sound. At
first nothing could be heard, save the sighing of the wind
through the trees, but the practiced ears of the desperadoes
quickly distinguished the clatter of approaching hoofs.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed the man who had given the signal
of alarm, casting an inquiring look at his leader.</p>

<p>“It’s a party o’ those cursed rebels from the fort, and we
must go into the woods until they pass, or they’ll be on our backs
in no time.”</p>

<p>As he said this, he turned toward Imogene, and, drawing
a pistol from his belt, ordered her to dismount.</p>

<p>“Dismount, I tell ye,” cried the ruffian, in a voice husky
with rage, seeing that Imogene utterly disregarded his command,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“or by th’ light o’ Heaven, I’ll put this piece o’ lead
through yer brain; for I’ve promised to deliver yer body, dead
or alive, and I’ll do so, should it cost me my life.”</p>

<p>Imogene looked at the villain, and saw by the fierce expression
of his countenance and the malignant fire that
sparkled in his eye, that he was capable of any enormity possible
to humanity, and would not hesitate an instant to put
his threat into execution.</p>

<p>There was no one to succor her; she beheld only the other
villains, his accomplices in crime. Oh, how she wished that
her noble Edgar was by her side, were it but for a moment.</p>

<p>“Make haste,” exclaimed the ruffian, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I refuse,” replied Imogene, with vehemence.</p>

<p>In an instant, before she could divine their intention, a
large mantle was suddenly cast over her head to prevent her
from making any outcry, and she was forcibly dragged from
her saddle and borne into the woods. In a moment afterward
the man who had held the rein of Imogene’s steed, uttering a
cry of pain, dashed after them.</p>

<p>“What’s all this noise about?” sharply asked the ruffian
leader, casting a savage look upon his comrade.</p>

<p>“The horse! the horse!” was all he could ejaculate, and
holding up his hand which was sadly cut and mangled,
“see there,” he cried, with an oath, “that infernal brute almost
wrenched my arm out of its socket with his teeth,” and
holding tightly on the wounded member, he groaned aloud
with the excruciating pain.</p>

<p>“Ye’d better stop that howlin’ o’ yours, afore ye bring th’
whole rebel pack down upon us,” was the consoling remark.
The wounded man, with a look of pain and hatred, obeyed.</p>

<p>The heavy tramp of horses denoted the rapid advance of
the troopers, and the bushes had hardly closed on the form of
the last of the retreating rascals, when they rode swiftly by the
hiding-place of their foe, looking like so many ghostly images,
as the moonbeams faintly reflected on their clanking sabers,
and the garnished trappings of their steeds.</p>

<p>When the last sound of the retreating horsemen had died
away in the distance, the leader of the party noiselessly
emerged from his place of concealment, and took a short,
quick survey of the surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<p>Upon observing their freedom from all immediate danger,
he ordered his companions to mount with all possible expedition.
Carefully placing the swooning and almost inanimate
form of Imogene on the back of his own horse, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Now, then, put yer horses to the test, for we must place
many miles betwixt us and this spot afore daylight; for that
bloody red-skin, War-Cloud, is at th’ fort, and if he gets on
our trail, only a miracle ’ll save us from goin’ under. Should
th’ rebel dogs overtake us, they’ll show us no quarters.”</p>

<p>In obedience to the command of their captain, one of the
party rode some distance in advance, in order to keep a sharp
look-out for any signs of danger; the leader with his helpless
burden occupied the center; while the wounded man, who
was engaged in binding up his lacerated hand, guarded the
rear.</p>

<p>In this manner they proceeded for several miles in silence,
not a sound breaking the deep and deathlike stillness of the
forest, except the dull echoes of the horses’ tread.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the verge of the woods through
which they were traveling, and were about to enter upon the
highway, in order to pursue their way more rapidly, trusting
to the darkness as a safeguard against their being observed,
and the proximity of the woods into which they could plunge
in case of the approach of any suspicious party, when the
man in front gave a low whistle as a signal to halt.</p>

<p>Riding back to his companions, he pointed out to them
through the trees, a faint, glimmering light that appeared to
issue from a large house near the roadside, but so nearly hidden
in an angle of the woods, that they almost came upon it
unawares. This was no other than the residence of the old
Whig who had been so cruelly murdered during the visit of
Iron Hand’s band the evening previous.</p>

<p>After debating among themselves for several moments the
one who had first given the alarm agreed to go and reconnoiter
the place. Dismounting, he hastened across the road,
and disappeared in the shadows of the trees that nearly surrounded
the habitation.</p>

<p>His friends, in their place of concealment, anxious to hear
the result. After an elapse of about half an hour he returned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and informed his comrades that the house was apparently
empty, and that the inmates had either fled or been taken
captives, as he had minutely examined several of the apartments,
and there was not a single sound to denote the presence
of any living being about the premises.</p>

<p>At this piece of intelligence, the three ruffians concluded
that instead of proceeding further on their journey, as both
themselves and their horses were greatly fatigued by their
rapid traveling, to take up their abode for the remainder of
the night in their newly-discovered place of shelter.</p>

<p>The trio advanced cautiously until they reached the house,
where they dismounted and securely fastened their animals.
The horses, together with the still insensible person of Imogene,
were left in charge of the wounded member of the party,
while the other two entered the building.</p>

<p>All was silence within. At the end of a large hall into
which they had ushered themselves, was a wide stair-case
leading to the room where the light was first discovered.
Looking into several smaller apartments without seeing any
suspicious sign, the two worthies concluded that the place was
still unoccupied, and immediately prepared to proceed to the
room above, in order to ascertain the cause of the light which
they had seen.</p>

<p>As they ascended, the stairs creaked and groaned, sending
forth at every step a hollow, dismal sound, whose echoes
broke the monotonous stillness, and lent additional horror to
the deep gloom that pervaded the entire place.</p>

<p>Entering the chamber, a scene of terrible confusion was
spread before their eyes. Broken and disarranged furniture
was scattered in every direction, while on the end of the
mantel near one of the windows, stood a light with the flame
just flickering in the socket. This it was that first attracted
the attention of the abducting party.</p>

<p>It was obvious by the great disorder everywhere visible,
that the inmates had decamped in haste, as not a single piece
of furniture had been removed, and that the house had been recently
abandoned, either in consequence of a real or expected
attack.</p>

<p>It was also apparent that the place had not been deserted
more than an hour or two. Evidently the last resident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
entertained little apprehension of an unwelcome visit, as
the light in the apartment was so placed that its rays could
be easily distinguished by the least observant passing that
way.</p>

<p>Could it be that the inmates had heard their approach and
had secreted themselves until they had fairly entrapped their
victims? As this thought suggested itself to the minds of the
two ruffians, a cold perspiration bathed their brows, and they
were on the point of beating a hasty retreat; but being reassured
by the prevailing quietude, they endeavored, with an
air of assumed bravado, to rally their drooping courage.</p>

<p>In a noiseless, but faltering manner, they commenced an
examination of the apartment. One of them gave a sudden
bound, accidentally knocking over a chair in his fright, as he
trod on some small, hard object lying on the floor.</p>

<p>“Curse on ye!” exclaimed his companion, in a tone of
mingled alarm and anger, “ye’ll bring th’ whole neighborhood
about our ears.”</p>

<p>Assuring themselves, however, that the noise had not
aroused anybody, they continued their search. As the ruffian
who had been startled so suddenly, stooped down to ascertain
the cause of his alarm, the dim rays of the candle reflected
on a richly-mounted dagger.</p>

<p>He picked it up, and was about to place it in his girdle,
when his comrade, the leader of the party, who was watching
his movements, caught sight of the glittering blade.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he asked, as he rudely grasped the arm of
the other.</p>

<p>“Only a knife.”</p>

<p>“By heavens, I’ve seen that knife afore!” he soliloquized,
as they both minutely examined the instrument by the aid of
the candle’s faint and flickering flame.</p>

<p>The handle of the weapon was tastefully ornamented with
mother-of-pearl and several beautiful and sparkling brilliants,
denoting that the owner was of no ordinary rank. They held
it closer to the light in order to inspect what appeared to be
spots of rust on the keen but peculiar-shaped blade.</p>

<p>“Blood! as I’m a livin’ man.”</p>

<p>“And fresh blood at that,” replied the other, as he scrutinized
it more closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p>“See!” was the excited exclamation.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Those letters,” answered the leader, as he pointed to the
initials “I. H.” handsomely engraved on the hilt of the weapon.</p>

<p>“Wal, what of ’em?”</p>

<p>“Don’t yer know?”</p>

<p>After slowly repeating the letters over several times in
his endeavors to unravel the enigma, the other quickly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I have it&mdash;the knife’s our chief’s.”</p>

<p>“Sartinly.”</p>

<p>“Wonder how it came here?”</p>

<p>“Th’ chief hisself or some of th’ league have been around
and at work.”</p>

<p>They then proceeded without delay to look about them for
some traces of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">melée</i>  . The walls were besmeared in several
places with clots of blood, giving unmistakable signs of an
encounter, while in the center of the floor was a small pool
of human gore not yet dry, denoting that the victim, whether
dead or wounded, had been but recently removed.</p>

<p>The expiring flame of the candle threw a sickly glare over
the apartment, wrapping every thing in a ghostly gloom. The
ruffians, though steeled to scenes of blood and murder, could
not drive away the indescribable feeling of awe that crept
over them as they stood there alone.</p>

<p>The bloody weapon of their chieftain, the not-to-be-mistaken
marks of a recent combat, the light, the deserted house
with its entire contents intact&mdash;all these, to the minds of the
ruffians, were an unbroken chain of circumstances which to
them was an inexplicable mystery.</p>

<p>Murder and rapine in their direst forms they could look
upon unflinchingly, but to be there alone, with nothing but
the dumb and sanguinary witnesses of the slaughtered victim
around them, was more than their treacherous souls could
withstand.</p>

<p>Filled with superstitious fears, they hastened precipitately
down the stairs, casting occasional furtive glances behind
them, and ceased not their hasty retreat until they had reached
their horses, which quickly mounting, they drove their rowels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
into their flanks and in a moment were dashing down the
road in hurried flight.</p>

<p>Not a word was uttered until they were satisfied that they
had placed themselves beyond the reach of all danger, real or
imaginary, when they checked their steeds, and related to
their wondering and almost bewildered comrade what they
had seen.</p>

<p>After a short and silent ride, the party finally reached a
small, but pretty and tasteful, dwelling, surrounded by neat
and beautiful grounds. It presented no appearance of wanton
injury and desolation, and was quite a pleasing contrast to
the numerous forsaken and half-burned houses that everywhere
abounded in that part of the country.</p>

<p>This pleasant retreat was evidently abandoned by its former
occupants, as the three ruffians approached it unhesitatingly,
without using their customary precautions. The
place was, no doubt, one of the many resorts belonging to
the band of which these men were members, and had been
spared from the general waste to be reserved for this purpose.</p>

<p>Having made secure the apartment in which Imogene was
placed, so as to prevent escape, the trio, before a large, crackling
wood fire which they had enkindled on the hearth, prepared
to make themselves as comfortable as circumstances
would permit.</p>

<p>After discussing the creature comforts with appetites rendered
extremely sharp by their weary ride, two of the party,
while the other mounted guard for the night, rolled themselves
in their blankets and were soon buried in slumber.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE HOT TRAIL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> leaving the fort, the dragoons followed the well-worn
but solitary path leading to the residence of Mr. Lear,
which they were certain Imogene had taken.</p>

<p>Onward they swiftly rode, hoping at every moment to overtake
their intended charge. Though they frequently listened
to catch the slightest sound, however, nothing was audible
save the monotonous rattling of their sabers.</p>

<p>The deep baying of hounds, the same that had awakened
Imogene from her reverie, told them they were near their journey’s
end. In a few moments afterward the dragoons drew
up their panting steeds before the residence of Thomas Lear.</p>

<p>All was still. The lieutenant dismounted and rapped
loudly on the door with the hilt of his saber. Finding that
the summons was unanswered, he repeated his rap with
redoubled vehemence. The echo had hardly died away
when the door was partly opened, and a negro domestic peering
cautiously out inquired the reason of their visit at such
an unseemly hour.</p>

<p>Hearing, in reply to her question, the deep, heavy tones of
a man’s voice, and seeing the person himself garbed in the
habiliments of a continental soldier, she was about to quickly
close the door in her fright; but the assurance that she was
to be in no wise molested filled her with more confidence, and
after some hesitancy she admitted the strange visitors.</p>

<p>Upon making inquiries, the lieutenant was astounded to
find that Imogene had not yet returned, and was on the point
of dispatching some of his men to scour the woods in the
vicinity, when her steed, riderless and with saddle and girth
nearly torn from his back, came dashing up the lawn.</p>

<p>Mr. Lear, on hearing the loud tones of the conversation
carried on below, hurried down-stairs. Seeing a party of soldiers
congregated before his house, his mind was filled with
forebodings of some impending calamity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this unseasonable visit?” he
eagerly inquired, turning to the lieutenant of the dragoons.</p>

<p>“We have come in obedience to the command of Colonel
Hall, to ascertain whether Miss Lear has yet arrived from the
fort, which she persisted in leaving this evening unattended.”</p>

<p>“Imogene at the fort! What mean you&mdash;how came she
there?”</p>

<p>“She was at the ball, sir.”</p>

<p>“At the ball! You mystify me&mdash;explain yourself;” but
just at that moment, catching sight of the riderless steed, he
started back with an agonizing groan. “I understand,” he
murmured, “something has happened to Imogene.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I fear there has been foul play.”</p>

<p>“No, no, there must be some dreadful mistake here!” exclaimed
the old man, nervously grasping the arm of the officer.
“Who could be so base as to harm my child?”</p>

<p>“In truth, the affair is enveloped in profound mystery.
We have examined the horse and find no traces of blood,
and I greatly fear that your daughter has been&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Mr. Lear, seeing the soldier hesitate.</p>

<p>“Abducted.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my God! what new villainy is this!” and the sorrow-stricken
parent staggered at the fearful intelligence.
Clutching the lieutenant with feverish suddenness, he frantically
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh! save my daughter, my darling girl! Reclaim her
from the hands of those merciless fiends, and my property,
my life, my all is yours! Oh! my child! my child! my
child!” and with a heartrending cry, the poor afflicted father
reeled, then sunk to the floor.</p>

<p>Leaving the grief-stricken old man in the care of his weeping
servants, with the assurance that nothing would be left
undone to recover Miss Lear from the hands of her abductors,
the lieutenant vaulted into his saddle, and in company with
his men hurried back to the fort to impart to the commandant
the unwelcome news.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant,” said Colonel Hall, after the officer had related
to him what had taken place, “you will hold yourself
and command in readiness to start at break of day, in
pursuit of these villains.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>

<p>The dragoon was about departing, when the colonel stopped
him.</p>

<p>“The Indian, War-Cloud, is still in the garrison, is he
not?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He is, sir.”</p>

<p>“Send him to me, then, without delay.”</p>

<p>The officer bowed and retired. The Indian quickly
obeyed the summons.</p>

<p>War-Cloud was a chief of the Oneidas. Although a great
part of his tribe went over to the British with the Five Nations,
of which it was a member, he always remained a
stanch friend of the Americans, and an inveterate foe of the
Mohawks.</p>

<p>He was one of the most trustworthy scouts attached to
the Continental army, and in that capacity had performed invaluable
service in the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>To Captain Sherwood he was especially attached, and
would have been ready at any moment to sacrifice his life in
his behalf. A large, crackling wood-fire shed its rays about
the room which he entered.</p>

<p>As the Indian stood there, calmly awaiting the pleasure of
his commander, with his arms quietly folded on his breast,
with the beautiful war-plumes that decorated his head drooping
over his countenance so as to give a more somber shade
to his finely-molded features, he looked like some brazen
colossus and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau-ideal</i>   of a true warrior.</p>

<p>Colonel Hall was pacing up and down the apartment,
deeply absorbed in meditation. He stopped a moment and
looked up.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed, as he beheld his visitor, “you have
come!”</p>

<p>Placing a chair near the table for the scout, he seated himself
opposite.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are aware of the reason that has caused
me to send for you?” continued the colonel.</p>

<p>The Indian bowed in response.</p>

<p>“You have already heard of the abduction of Miss Lear?”</p>

<p>“War-Cloud knows all,” answered the scout.</p>

<p>“Then you will hold yourself ready to accompany the
troopers on the trail of the abductors in the morning.” After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
giving the Indian his instructions, the commander dismissed
him.</p>

<p>The remainder of the night was spent by a greater part
of the inmates of the fort, in a state of feverish excitement.
It was deemed prudent to withhold the knowledge of Imogene’s
abduction from Captain Sherwood, until more particulars
of her fate were obtained.</p>

<p>The next morning, just as the bright sun commenced to
tint the neighboring hill-tops and light up the eastern horizon,
witnessed the departure of the dragoons from the fort.</p>

<p>They immediately took the path of the previous evening,
which they slowly followed, scrutinizing every foot of the
ground minutely, until they reached the spot where Imogene
had been stopped by her abductors. This they knew by the
trampled state of the earth.</p>

<p>Dismounting, War-Cloud made a careful examination of
the numerous footprints, while the remainder of the company
patiently awaited the result of his investigation.</p>

<p>Quickly beckoning the commander to his side, the scout
pointed to several deep prints in the soft soil.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s peculiar about them?” asked the officer, inspecting
them closely.</p>

<p>“White man’s tracks.”</p>

<p>“White men’s! How know you that?”</p>

<p>“See!” exclaimed the scout, as he directed the officer’s attention
to several nearly erased marks, “Indian no wear boots&mdash;Indian
wear moccasin.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, there, in the loose earth, were imprinted the
faint outlines of boot-traces. Penetrating the trampled bushes
on either side of the path, War-Cloud at length came upon
the spot where the inanimate form of Imogene had been placed
during the passage of the dragoons.</p>

<p>These signs not only satisfied the party that they had struck
upon the right trail, but also gave convincing proof that the
abductors were white men, not Indians, as at first supposed.</p>

<p>Without stopping to waste any more time in words, the
dragoons started on the trail, with War-Cloud a short distance
in advance. The traces of the fugitives were so broad and
plain, and so little care had been taken to conceal them, that
they could be followed with but little difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<p>However, as the troopers entered deeper into the heart of
the forest, their progress became slower and more difficult, and
the trail less distinct.</p>

<p>At length, however, they reached the deserted house where
the abducting party had stopped the previous evening. They
surrounded the building, but this precaution was unnecessary,
as a hasty examination showed that their intended victims had
departed several hours before.</p>

<p>The old trail was again resumed, which led them to the
dwelling in which we left Imogene and her abductors in the
previous chapter.</p>

<p>It was now dark, and the obscurity and quietude in which
the house was buried seemed to foreshadow another disappointment.
The lieutenant knocked loudly at the door; no
answer. He knocked again; still no answer. He was about
to effect an entrance by force, when the shadow of a man was
observed to flit across the lawn.</p>

<p>The dragoons started in hurried pursuit. Through the dim
twilight the fugitive was hardly distinguishable. He had almost
reached the woods&mdash;in another moment he would be
safe, when the sharp, whip-like report of War-Cloud’s rifle
was heard, and the fleeing man fell to the dust.</p>

<p>The next instant he was surrounded by his pursuers, who
made a litter for him with their rifles, and carried him to the
house. The injured man was bleeding copiously, and appeared
to be seriously, if not mortally wounded.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and what were you doing here?” inquired
the lieutenant, after seeing that the sufferer’s position had been
made as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>“What’s thet to ye?” was the surly reply.</p>

<p>“Come, come, my good fellow, you had better be a little
more communicative, for I think your time is growing short.”</p>

<p>“What’s thet ye say?” exclaimed the man, with a sudden
start.</p>

<p>“I fear your injury is fatal.”</p>

<p>“Do ye think so?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“If thet’s the case, Tom Turley had better tell all afore he
goes under, for he hez a purty good deal thet weighs on his
mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p>“Be brief.”</p>

<p>“Send yer cap’n to me; I’ll tell no other.”</p>

<p>“I am the sole commander here.”</p>

<p>To this the man uttered a guttural, unintelligible response
and then remained quiet. The lieutenant perceived that nothing
could be elicited from him, except by the closest interrogating.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m one of the Tory League,” answered the man, in a
low whisper.</p>

<p>At the mention of this name, a scowl darkened the brows
of the dragoons that were crowded around.</p>

<p>“How came you with that wound?” asked the officer, seeing
one of the hands of the Tory ill-bandaged and bloody.</p>

<p>“I got bit by a horse belongin’ to a gal thet myself and
two more of the band wor carryin’ off.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the lieutenant, springing suddenly to
his feet; “you, then, were one of the abductors of Miss
Lear?”</p>

<p>“Thet’s the name, but&mdash;quick&mdash;water! water!” A drink
was immediately given him.</p>

<p>“Who were your companions, and where are they? Tell
me what has become of Miss Lear!” but before any reply could
be made to these questions, a short, burly individual, a surgeon,
had elbowed his way through the crowd and reached
the wounded man.</p>

<p>He had accompanied the dragoons on the expedition, evidently
more for the sake of adventure than from any expectation
that his medical services would be required.</p>

<p>He had joined in the pursuit on foot, and it was several
minutes after the dragoons had returned to the house, before
he made his appearance.</p>

<p>Thrusting back the men who were collected around, eager
to hear what the Tory had to say, he proceeded to examine
the man’s wound.</p>

<p>The ball had entered the upper part of the shoulder, but
striking the blade, had taken a downward course and come
out at the back.</p>

<p>“It’s only a flesh wound,” said the surgeon, after he had
finished bandaging the injury; “the man has bled profusely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
which has made him weak, but in a few hours he will be all
right again.”</p>

<p>“What! then I’ll yet live?” exclaimed the man, with a
nervous shudder, a deathlike pallidness overspreading his
countenance.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly! you are worth a dozen dying men.”</p>

<p>At these words the man sunk back with a groan.</p>

<p>“But, my good fellow, why do you speak in this manner?”
asked the surgeon; “you don’t wish to die, do you?”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the Tory League, doctor, and thought he wor
goin’ under,” ventured to say one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>“One of the Tory League, eh?” exclaimed the surgeon,
with a look of surprise. “Ah! I understand his wish to die;
he’s afraid that he has escaped one mode of dying to suffer a
worse, which he has deserved a hundred times for his black
deeds.”</p>

<p>With an almost superhuman effort, the wounded man sprung
to his feet, his face livid with passion.</p>

<p>“Ye’ve desaved me!” he fairly shrieked, pointing his
bloody hand at the commander of the dragoons.</p>

<p>“I told you what I conscientiously thought to be true. I
believed you to be dying and I told you so. You betrayed
yourself,” calmly replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Ye lie! Ye’ve desaved me, I tell ye!” and with a howl
of rage, the ruffian, a fiendish look overspreading his scowling
brow, drew forth a dagger he had concealed in his bosom, and
sprung at the officer.</p>

<p>In an instant, he was seized by a dozen hands, and disarmed
before he could carry out his design. The villain, seeing
his plans frustrated, cast a diabolical look at his intended
victim, then settled into a dogged quietude.</p>

<p>“Answer the questions I put to you,” said the lieutenant,
approaching the Tory, “and you are a free man, though you
should have merited a thousand deaths for your bloody acts.”</p>

<p>The man only looked at his interlocutor, but made no answer.</p>

<p>“Tell me who were your companions, and what they have
done with Miss Lear,” continued the officer, “and on my
honor as a soldier, the moment I feel assured that you have
spoken the truth, you will be at liberty to depart unmolested.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<p>“Ye’ve desaved me once, and ye shan’t do it again.”</p>

<p>“I repeat my question. Will you or will you not tell me
the names of your companions, and whither they have taken
the young lady?”</p>

<p>“I’ll not!”</p>

<p>“Bring the prisoner without!” commanded the lieutenant,
in a stern voice.</p>

<p>The order was promptly obeyed, and the Tory was conducted
to the green in front of the dwelling.</p>

<p>The moon had already arisen, and its bright beams rendered
the night almost equal to day. A towering oak stood
a few yards from the door, and under its spreading branches
the soldiers had collected in a group, forming quite a picturesque
scene.</p>

<p>A strong rope was cast over one of the largest limbs, and a
dragoon quietly formed a sliding noose at the end. A small
cask was brought from the house and placed directly under
the hanging cord.</p>

<p>The prisoner watched these ominous preparations with suspicion.
The officer now approached him again.</p>

<p>“Will you answer the question that I have asked you?” he
said.</p>

<p>“I’ve tol’ ye once; ask me no more.”</p>

<p>“Men, do your duty!”</p>

<p>In an instant the prisoner’s hands were pinioned behind him,
and the rope placed around his neck.</p>

<p>“Mount,” said the officer.</p>

<p>The prisoner reluctantly placed himself on the cask. He
now began to surmise the true meaning of what was going
on, though at first he had half-suspected it was only a resort
to the old ruse of extorting information.</p>

<p>“What are ye goin’ to do wid me?” he asked, in a trembling
tone.</p>

<p>“You shall see presently,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“What does all this mean?” inquired the Tory, now thoroughly
alarmed at the manner of the soldiers.</p>

<p>“That you are going to suffer a penalty that you have too
often eluded, and which you merit but too well,” answered
the officer.</p>

<p>“Ye’re not goin’ to put me to death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

<p>“If you answer me what I have already asked you, no;
but if you refuse, yes!”</p>

<p>“If I answer yer questions am I free?”</p>

<p>“You are.”</p>

<p>“If I refuse?”</p>

<p>“Then you die.”</p>

<p>“Will you show me no mercy?”</p>

<p>“Think not of mercy, but of your God!”</p>

<p>“Look yere cap’n,” said the Tory, who, though a miscreant,
was no coward; “though ye wor to slice and quarter me, ye
couldn’t make Tom Turley blow on his comrades.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished uttering these last words when the
support was knocked from under him by a violent blow, and
he was left dangling in the air.</p>

<p>He struggled violently for several moments, then uttered a
piercing shriek:</p>

<p>“Help! help! cut the rope! Oh, God! mercy! mercy!
mercy! Iron Hand!&mdash;old man!&mdash;Hank Put&mdash;! I’ll t&mdash;t&mdash;t&mdash;”
His voice was hushed. The words, whatever they
were, assumed only a gurgling sound in his throat, then died
away in nothingness.</p>

<p>His limbs were slowly contracted, then as slowly straightened
out again. His hands were tightly clenched. The
finger-nails penetrated the flesh, making wounds from which
nearly stagnant blood slowly oozed, pattering in drops on the
leaves below.</p>

<p>He made a spasmodic effort to release his arms, but they
fell quivering by his side. A slight, convulsive shudder shook
his frame, and the soul of the Tory passed to its Maker.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a blast of wind, like a solemn dirge,
swept through the forest, chanting, as it were, the dead man’s
requiem. The body was left swinging in the breeze, as a warning
to all evil-doers, or until chance should direct the footsteps
of some stragglers to the spot.</p>

<p>Thoughtful, and pondering on the ruffian’s dying words, the
dragoons returned to the house, there to deliberate what next
should be done. After a short debate, they concluded to go
back to the fort in the morning, as it was evident that the
abducting party had either discovered their approach and
fled or had departed before their arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>

<p>In either case they would reach the British lines before
daylight, and as it was impossible to follow the trail by night,
the dragoons were obliged to abandon the pursuit.</p>

<p>Making themselves as comfortable as possible, the troopers
waited patiently until dawn, when they returned to the fort to
make known the result of the expedition.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE SECRET MISSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cool night air awakened Imogene from the unconscious
state into which she had fallen when first seized by her abductors.</p>

<p>Staring wildly around the apartment in which she was confined,
she was unable to account for her strange position.
Pressing her hot hands to her throbbing temples she tried to
collect her scattered thoughts.</p>

<p>The recollection of the events of the past evening appeared
to her like a terrible dream. Like a flash the thought occurred
to her that she had been abducted. To think of such
a thing almost crazed her brain.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” she wildly exclaimed, springing toward
the ruffian who was keeping guard at her chamber door.</p>

<p>Without heeding her question, he made a commanding gesture
for her to remain silent. She tried to draw him into
conversation, but in vain.</p>

<p>Seeing she could not gain any information, she seated herself
on the rude couch that had been prepared for her, and
commenced to reflect.</p>

<p>The excitement and fatigue of the past few hours, however,
were too much for her delicate frame, and in a few moments
she fell into a gentle slumber.</p>

<p>The guard, seeing his charge asleep, closed the door of
the chamber gently, and being wearied, seated himself near
the fire. After fruitless endeavors to keep his heavy eyelids
from closing, he was finally obliged to succumb to his drowsiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<p>His head fell heavily on his breast, his arms hung listlessly
by his side, and in a few moments he was slumbering heavily.
Imogene’s sleep was light and fitful. Her dreams were
haunted by the transactions of the past night.</p>

<p>In a short time she awoke. Hearing no movement outside,
she listened attentively for the monotonous tread of her
guard, but it had ceased. Nothing broke the awful stillness
save the heavy breathing of the sleeping ruffians.</p>

<p>Rising quickly, she peered cautiously out, and there, by
the dim light of the dying embers, she perceived her abductors
wrapped in sound slumber.</p>

<p>Hastily procuring what articles were necessary to protect
her against the chill air of the evening, she wrapped her
shawl around her person, and quietly entered the dimly lighted
room. Stepping lightly over the sleeping forms of her captors,
she fled down the stairs.</p>

<p>The cool air fanned her fevered brow, and seemed to impart
new strength to her exhausted frame. The inspiring
hopes of escaping from her villainous captors had a salutary
effect. Vaulting on the back of one of the horses that stood
ready equipped, she dashed away from the house.</p>

<p>The clattering of the horse’s hoofs aroused her guard.
Looking around him in a bewildered manner, he hurried to
where his prisoner was confined, only to find her gone.</p>

<p>“Awake! awake! to horse! to horse!” he frantically cried,
applying his foot in no gentle manner to the sleeping forms
of his companions.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked they, in a single breath, springing to
their feet.</p>

<p>“Our prisoner’s escaped!”</p>

<p>“The prisoner escaped!” they both exclaimed in one voice.</p>

<p>“Yes; look for yerselves!” answered the other, pointing
to the vacated chamber.</p>

<p>“To yer horses! We must hev the gal again, dead or
alive!” cried the ruffian leader, hurrying to where the animals
were picketed.</p>

<p>When they reached the spot, there were but two horses, the
third was gone. Imogene had unconsciously selected the
animal belonging to the wounded member of the party, and
the owner had no other alternative than to follow in the pursuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
on foot, or go back to the house and await the return of
his comrades. He chose the latter.</p>

<p>He slowly retraced his steps, muttering imprecations loud
and deep. The mounted ruffians hurried in pursuit of Imogene,
hoping every moment to catch some sound that would
direct them.</p>

<p>The chase was fruitless. They scoured the forest for miles
around, but were finally obliged to abandon the search.
Chagrined and disappointed by their ill-success, they were
slowly returning to where they had left their companion
that morning.</p>

<p>The day was drawing gradually to a close. The sun had already
disappeared behind the western hills, when the two ruffians
were suddenly confronted by a female&mdash;it was Imogene.</p>

<p>It appears that after leaving the house, she wandered, she
knew not whither, until chance directed her attention to a
small cavity near the roadside, where she lay concealed during
the greater part of the day without being discovered by
her pursuers.</p>

<p>The shades of night were fast approaching, wrapping the
grand old forest in a somber gloom, when Imogene awakened
to a sense of her lonely situation. As she pondered on her
isolated condition, her mind was filled with fear and dreadful
forebodings.</p>

<p>The thought, that she was there alone in that gloomy forest,
a prey to wild beasts and starvation, almost distracted
her. She almost wished that she had not effected her escape,
and was about to give vent to her wild grief, when the
tread of horses attracted her attention.</p>

<p>She paused and listened. Her ears had not deceived her.
There was no mistaking the sound&mdash;some one was approaching.
She quickly hid herself in the bushes, where she could
get a view of the passers-by.</p>

<p>She had not long to wait; the footsteps steadily approached,
and the next instant two horsemen loomed up in the distance.
What was it that made Imogene start, and sent the hot blood
coursing through her veins, as she caught sight of the foremost
stranger?</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes&mdash;it must be&mdash;it is <em>he</em>!” she murmured to herself.
She could with difficulty refrain from uttering a cry of joy, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
she recognized in the form of one of these men, the pretended
American scout and patriot&mdash;Hank Putney.</p>

<p>The sight of the scout reanimated her and restored her
drooping spirits, and she quickly determined to discover herself
to him and claim his protection until she should reach
some place of safety.</p>

<p>At the sudden appearance of Imogene, after her recapture
had been given up as hopeless, the scowl that darkened the
brows of the two ruffians gave place to a look of savage joy.</p>

<p>It was evident to Putney, for it was indeed he, that Imogene
had not yet recognized him as being one of her abductors, for
what other reason could possibly have induced her to surrender
herself into his hands unless it was that she still deemed
him to be the character he had so basely assumed&mdash;a stanch
American patriot, and the thought seemed to give infinite pleasure
to the ruffian.</p>

<p>“So we’ve found ye at last,” he growled.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hank!” exclaimed Imogene, with delight, without
noticing his rough salutation, as she approached the scout,
her hands extended to welcome him, “I am so glad to have
met you.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” answered Putney, with a sinister smile on his countenance.</p>

<p>“I have been in this dreary place the entire day, without
either food or drink,” and Imogene shuddered as she commenced
to relate the particulars of her abduction and escape,
but the scout interrupting her, replied:</p>

<p>“I know all about it.”</p>

<p>“Have you captured some of the miscreants?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly.”</p>

<p>“Then you have been informed of their vile plot?”</p>

<p>“That neither.”</p>

<p>“In what manner, then, did you acquire this knowledge?
You puzzle me, Hank&mdash;I can not understand you,” said Imogene,
growing a little nettled at his cold, formal manner.</p>

<p>“That’ll all be explained to ye soon enough. In the meanwhile
ye’ll mount and foller us,” he responded, at the same
time making a gesture to his comrade to lead forward Imogene’s
steed, which she had fastened near her place of concealment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>Depressed by the mysterious manner of Putney, Imogene,
with a heavy heart, mechanically obeyed his order. The two
ruffians stationed themselves on either side of her. These
precautions looked suspicious, and a chill of fear crept over
Imogene, as she witnessed them.</p>

<p>However, she quietly accompanied her companions, following
wherever they led. During their journey she endeavored
to draw her taciturn escort into a conversation, but without
success. After a weary ride of several miles, stopping suddenly,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I will proceed no further, until you tell me whither you
are leading me!”</p>

<p>“Ye won’t, eh! I’ll see about that.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“That, willin’ or unwillin’, ye must foller me.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“To th’ place ye left this mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Not back to the haunt of my villainous abductors?”</p>

<p>“’Xactly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Hank! You do not&mdash;you can not mean this!
Tell me that you are but jesting!” wildly exclaimed Imogene,
now thoroughly alarmed at the villain’s words.</p>

<p>“It’s th’ truth.”</p>

<p>“Then you are concerned in this plot?”</p>

<p>“If ye’ll hev it so, I am.”</p>

<p>“What! You do not mean to tell me, Hank, that <em>you, you</em>
are a traitor&mdash;that <em>you</em> are one of these ruffians!”</p>

<p>The Tory hesitated a moment before answering, but feeling
assured that he had nothing to fear in revealing his true character
to his captive, as it was beyond her power to do him
harm, he turned abruptly and replied:</p>

<p>“Yes. Hereafter ye’ll know me, not as Hank, th’ American
scout and patriot, but as Putney, th’ spy of th’ Tory League!”</p>

<p>This announcement, like the sting of some venomous serpent,
sunk deep into the heart of Imogene. For a moment
she seemed completely paralyzed.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens! then I am lost!” she murmured, seeing
how basely she had been betrayed, and how unwarily she had
surrendered herself into the clutches of the villains.</p>

<p>The fact that Hank Putney and the leader of her abductors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
were one and the same person, was more than she could
seem to realize. To her, the greatness of the man’s crime
was only equaled by his perfidy.</p>

<p>Her spirit was almost crushed by the acknowledged treachery
of him in whom she had reposed so much confidence, and
she resigned herself to her fate.</p>

<p>The party continued the remainder of their journey in silence.
The moon had risen bright and full, when they arrived
near the house in which the ruffians had left their companion
to await their return.</p>

<p>As they emerged from the forest to cross the lawn leading
to the dwelling, a slight breeze shook the tall pines&mdash;a peculiar
sound reached their ears&mdash;the lengthened shadow of a
human body stretched across the moonlit sward, reaching nigh
to their very feet in its vacillating course.</p>

<p>They stopped&mdash;looked up&mdash;when, oh, horror! they beheld
a spectacle sufficient to harrow up their very souls.</p>

<p>There, pendent between heaven and earth, with its form
clearly outlined against the bright sky, was a black, frightful,
hideous corpse, once their own cheerful comrade, now no
more.</p>

<p>As it slowly swayed to and fro, moved by the gentle wind,
with the pale moonbeams reflecting on the grim, distorted
countenance, with features ghastly and repulsive, with eyes
staring and glassy, that seemed to protrude from their sockets
in their endeavors to pierce, as it were, the impenetrable darkness
that enveloped the path of the soul, the ill-boding, shrill
screams of the birds of prey, as they struggled and fought
over their ghostly banquet of flesh, was a sight too dreadful
to look upon.</p>

<p>The ruffians turned their heads in disgust from the horrible
sight, and dragging more than leading Imogene, who seemed
chained to the spot by some terrible fascination, they hurried
away.</p>

<p>The ominous cries of the carnivorous birds still rung in
their ears&mdash;sounds that penetrated the deepest chambers of
their own dark hearts, pricking their consciences with the
knowledge of the loathsome deeds there secreted.</p>

<p>On, on they hurried, through brier, bramble, and thicket,
stopping not even to cast a single glance behind them, lest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
they should again see the spectral figure of their late companion,
until they had satisfied themselves that they had nothing
to fear from ghost or human, when they reined in their
panting steeds to recover breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, God! thet wor awful!” exclaimed Putney, in a
husky voice. “Poor Tom wor a plucky one; but that wor
an awful death to die!” and he covered his face with his
brawny hands, trying to shut out the terrible scene from his
imagination.</p>

<p>The corpse was that of their companion, to whom, that
morning, the dragoons had administered such summary justice.</p>

<p>After a moment of respite, Putney gave the signal to again
press onward. Over fallen trees, through swamp and morass,
up the steep hill and across the valley, they hurried with a
precipitation which naught but their superstitious fears could
have created.</p>

<p>Their progress was at length arrested by the small stream
that flowed into Lake George, between Forts William Henry
and George. One of the party reconnoitered the bank for
some distance to find a fordable place.</p>

<p>Finally the desired spot was discovered, and they succeeded
in passing over in safety, receiving only a slight wetting.
They were so near the forts, that the distant roll of the drums
and winding of the bugles could be heard distinctly.</p>

<p>Putney urged the party to their utmost celerity. He was
in great trepidation lest he should come across some scouting
party returning to the fort. However, the crisis passed safely
over, and they breathed freely as they escaped beyond the
American lines.</p>

<p>After a short but wearisome ride, Putney signaled the party
to halt and dismount. The spot at which they stopped was
at the base of a large hill, possessed, in no respect, of any peculiarities
to distinguish it from the landscape of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>Putney pushed his way through a large clump of bushes
that grew some distance back from the roadside, and made a
sign for the others to follow him.</p>

<p>They proceeded cautiously along a secret path that wound
around the base of the mountain, and at length stopped before
a large cavity partly concealed by shrubbery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p>Putney knocked on a small door that barred what appeared
to be the entrance to a cave. The bolts were slowly withdrawn,
and the door cautiously opened by a dark, sullen-looking
man, who held a large bunch of keys in his hand.</p>

<p>A nod of recognition was exchanged between this personage
and Putney, and the party was allowed to enter. The
place into which they were introduced, bore a dismal, somber
appearance.</p>

<p>Benches were scattered promiscuously about, while on the
side walls were hung all sorts of martial implements. Not
a single person, however, was visible: all was as quiet as the
grave.</p>

<p>They were conducted along a large corridor dimly lighted
a by a single lantern, <ins class="corr" id="tn59" title="Transcriber’s Note—“whose feeble glare served only to highten” changed to “whose feeble glare served only to heighten”.">whose feeble glare served only to heighten</ins>
the gloominess of the situation.</p>

<p>Imogene was ushered into a brilliantly illuminated apartment,
which, from all appearances, had, no doubt, been fitted
up for her special reception.</p>

<p>She gazed about her with a half-bewildered air. The
apartment was a magnificent one. There was a lavish display
of grandeur, unsurpassed in many of our wealthiest drawing
rooms.</p>

<p>From the ceiling hung a beautiful pendent, with variegated
lights. The tapestried walls were grandiosely decorated in
the richest and most artistic manner.</p>

<p>In the center of the room stood a table with vases, containing
the choicest and rarest flowers, whose fragrant exhalations
perfumed the whole apartment, serving to dispel the
disagreeable odors emanating from the naturally damp
walls.</p>

<p>The whole appearance of the place was strikingly at variance
with the rest of the interior of this mysterious cavern.
Recovering from her fit of abstraction into which she had
fallen, Imogene rushed to the door of her prison, for this we
must term it, to try and gain an egress, but it was securely
barred.</p>

<p>She then turned her attention to the walls, lest perchance
there might be some secret avenue to escape, but her hopes
in that direction were speedily blasted.</p>

<p>Again she returned to her prison door, and with frantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
energy shook it violently, but it was proof against her feeble
strength.</p>

<p>In an agony of despair, she cried aloud for assistance;
however, naught save the echoes of her own voice gave
back an answer.</p>

<p>“Lost! lost! lost!” she cried! “May Heaven defend and
guide me in this, my hour of peril!”</p>

<p>The exertions she had made were too much for her delicate
and exhausted frame. Tottering to a small couch that
stood at the further end of the room, she cast herself upon
it, and burying her face in her hands, gave vent to her grief.</p>

<p>Gradually a sense of drowsiness stole over her, and succumbing
to nature’s wants, she soon was lost in slumber.
How long she remained thus, she knew not, when she was
awakened by the creaking of her prison door as some person
entered.</p>

<p>Remaining silent, she listened. The footsteps approached
the middle of the apartment, then stopped. She started in
alarm from her reclining posture and confronted her silent
visitor.</p>

<p>He was a tall and stately personage, with an authoritative
and commanding mien. His face was carefully concealed
in the folds of an ample cloak that fell gracefully from his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Why this intrusion, sir?”</p>

<p>“No intrusion, fair lady, only a friendly visit.”</p>

<p>At the sound of the stranger’s voice Imogene involuntarily
drew back.</p>

<p>“That voice&mdash;surely I have heard it before&mdash;it is so like
<em>his</em>!” she whispered to herself. “Who are you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Behold!” exclaimed the stranger, throwing off his disguise.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens! Maurice!” and Imogene, trembling in
every joint, staggered against the wall for support.</p>

<p>“Yes, Imogene!” replied her visitor, making a bow, half
courteous, half ironical&mdash;“it is I.”</p>

<p>“For what reasons are you here?&mdash;you, whom all thought
to be hundreds of leagues hence?”</p>

<p>“To express my love to you. Yes, Imogene&mdash;it is the
great love I bear you that has placed me here, and made
me what you see me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<p>“Are you a voluntary inmate of this horrid place?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“And these wretched men that brought me hither?”</p>

<p>“Are my subordinates.”</p>

<p>“But they, according to their own confession, are members
of that notorious band called the Tory League. Are you
then, numbered among their associates?”</p>

<p>“I am&mdash;their leader.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that <em>you</em>&mdash;but I dare not mention
that terrible name; the very thought of it makes my
blood run cold with horror.”</p>

<p>“It is but too true&mdash;I <em>do</em> bear that name which none have
learned to repeat, save to visit with curses and execrations
the head of its possessor&mdash;Iron Hand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; that dreadful synonym for bloody murder
and rapine.”</p>

<p>“Imogene, you judge me too harshly. Though hated by
mankind; though my name be whispered in accents of fear
and loathing, yet I am not so bad as the world would have me.
One thing always has sustained me when on the very verge
of despair, and like a celestial guide, has directed my footsteps,
and bid me hope when all around me was ingulfed
in misery and darkness&mdash;it is the thought, that you might
yet look upon me more kindly; that you might at some
future day, even learn to love me.”</p>

<p>“Talk not to me of love! Know you not that I am already
betrothed&mdash;that my hand is already plighted to another?”</p>

<p>“Ay! I know it but too well. It is that that has compelled
me to have recourse to these extreme measures; it is the
burning love that is consuming me, that has goaded me on to
undertake that which in my better moments I would scorn to
do.”</p>

<p>“Is it to avow your vile passion that you have torn me from
my happy home, and brought sorrow to the heart of my venerable
father? Is it for that purpose that you have seduced
America’s sons from their allegiance&mdash;that you have enlisted
in your service the silvery locks of age, and made them subservient
tools for the furtherance of your diabolical schemes?
It is for this, then, that you have outraged propriety, modesty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and the laws of God and man? Is it thus you expect to be
successful? You speak of love; yes, it is like that the hawk
bears the dove, merely to toy with its victim for a time, then
to rend it in pieces with its talons. Thank God! I have penetrated
your disguise, and understand your villainous designs&mdash;I
am no longer deceived. Your heart is black and treacherous,
your soul stained with crimes innumerable, and honor
has fled the breast of one so corrupted!”</p>

<p>The Tory chieftain drew back at the passionate energy of
Imogene’s manner. His rage stood revealed in his pale and
distorted face; but suppressing his anger&mdash;he thought it policy&mdash;he
replied with affected composure:</p>

<p>“You know not, Imogene, how I have loved and love you.
Even supposing that I have acted with any rashness in this,
why will you insist on my suffering for it? Why should reproaches
be added to rejection, as if to make the cup of bitterness
more full? Come, Imogene, we must yet be friends. I
do not press you for an immediate answer; but tell me you
will think of me, and think more kindly, and I will be happy.
I go now, but will return on the morrow to receive my answer.”</p>

<p>Bowing low, he turned to depart.</p>

<p>“Hold! hold, sir!” exclaimed Imogene. “I wish to be harassed
no further by these unwelcome visits. Your very presence
fills me with a loathsome feeling I can not express. You
can not deceive me by your duplicity. I know your purposes
are vile. Hear then my answer. It is irrevocable and absolute.
I hate you! I despise you! My soul tells me that
you are worse than you appear. You have bribed a villain
with a heart as black as your own, to deliver me into your
power. Think you that vengeance sleepeth? No! its loud
cry will rise to Heaven until you perish beneath its withering
influence!”</p>

<p>As she spoke these words, with an energy beyond what she
had ever shown, the fire that smoldered on the hearth fell in,
and caused a sudden light to fill the place.</p>

<p>It shone ruddy brown upon the beautiful but stern face and
uplifted arm of Imogene, and gave to her the appearance of
an angel denouncing on the head of the villain before her the
sentence of eternal woe.</p>

<p>It glared likewise upon the pale countenance of the Tory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
and gave to his distorted features a look of ghastliness and
fear that might have suited such an occasion well.</p>

<p>The awe-inspiring picture lasted but for a second, then vanished.
The fire again sunk low, the light grew dim. It came
like a dismal vision, and like a vision faded.</p>

<p>This was more than her visitor had expected. He felt how
thoroughly he was despised, and for a moment was speechless;
but quickly recovering himself, a Satanic look overspread
his countenance, and his eyes glared with a furious fire
as he fairly hissed these words between his teeth:</p>

<p>“You have given me <em>your</em> answer, now list ye to <em>mine</em>!
When we were but mere children together, you rejected my
boyish love&mdash;you looked down upon me with scorn and contempt
as you do now&mdash;you spurned me from you as though
I were a dog, without pity, without mercy! Think you that
I am impervious to such wrongs, such insults? Think you
that you can with impunity beard the lion in his den, without
reaping the result of your audacity? Mark ye! I will
give you three days to reconsider your rash decision; at the
expiration of that time, I will return for a final answer.
Should you refuse me, then you are mine&mdash;mine, body and
soul. There is no one to whom you can appeal for assistance&mdash;none
that can help you. I alone possess that power, and
should you disdain to avail yourself of it, then you are irretrievably
lost!” and with a demoniac laugh, the Tory rushed
from the place.</p>

<p>Imogene gazed for a moment with a wild stare after the
retreating form of her late visitor, then reeled, and sunk
swooning to the floor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morning succeeding the arrest of Captain Sherwood
dawned clear and beautiful. The bright sunbeams struggled
through the narrow, grated window of Edgar’s cell, and brilliantly
illuminated the apartment.</p>

<p>When he gazed about him, and beheld the joyful sunlight
streaming athwart the floor of his prison, his feelings were too
painful for description&mdash;it seemed, as it were, that every thing
mocked him.</p>

<p>“Would that I could dispel these gloomy thoughts that
possess me,” he murmured. “There is an indescribable something&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
feeling of sadness I can not banish. Shake it off I
can not&mdash;it clings to me despite my efforts, and I feel as
though it were a precursor of some terrible affliction about to
befall me.”</p>

<p>While these despondent thoughts occupied his mind, he remained
leaning with his shoulder against the wall, and gazing
with a troubled look upon the decaying fire, when Colonel
Hall entered the cell.</p>

<p>“Ah, good-morning, colonel,” exclaimed Edgar; “I am
so glad to see you; your presence makes me feel less sad.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, captain; I hope you are well.”</p>

<p>“Yes, colonel, well in body, though not in spirit. But
why do <em>you</em> look so sad? Are you in trouble?”</p>

<p>“Yes, captain, I am.”</p>

<p>“Then we are companions in misfortune.”</p>

<p>“Would to God that we were!”</p>

<p>“Why? Do you so commiserate the unhappiness of
others, that you are willing to share it with them?”</p>

<p>“The affliction is not so much my own, captain, as my
friend’s.”</p>

<p>“Your friend! Ah! then there is another to whom you
may offer condolence. May I inquire his name?”</p>

<p>“Alas! you know it but too well; the person is&mdash;yourself!”</p>

<p>“Myself! Is there then some new tale of woe&mdash;some additional
sorrow to be added to my already heavy burden?
Tell it me, I beseech you, colonel&mdash;keep me not in suspense.”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Captain Sherwood, that you may listen to
me.”</p>

<p>Drawing his seat close to that of Edgar, Colonel Hall, in
as gentle a manner as possible, related to him Imogene’s sudden
and mysterious disappearance, the success of the party
that he had dispatched in search of her, and their return to
the fort that morning.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this sad intelligence, Edgar uttered a
deep groan. His head sunk forward on his knees in an access
of deep emotion, and his eyes were fixed with a vacant
stare on the floor.</p>

<p>For several moments, silence, gloomy and profound, reigned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
Raising his head slowly, his face, which was now pale and
haggard, presented a picture of despair.</p>

<p>“What have they done with her?” he faintly asked.</p>

<p>“At present I am unable to answer you. The prisoner
that was captured, and from whom the information which I
have imparted to you was elicited, remained reticent on that
point. However, I will use the most strenuous exertions to
have the mystery unraveled in a satisfactory manner. Too
long has the border ran with the blood of the victims of
these cut-throats. I will have them hunted down wheresoever
they be, till they pay the penalty of their villainous
deeds,” exclaimed Colonel Hall, in an emphatic tone, a stern
look settling on his brow.</p>

<p>“Heaven bless and reward you, colonel, for your kindness
to me.”</p>

<p>“Mention it not, Captain Sherwood, I beg of you. I have
done no more to you, than I would have expected you to do
me under like circumstances. I must tarry no longer, however,
as the time flies swiftly by, and my men are under orders,
impatiently awaiting my commands.”</p>

<p>His hand was already on the latch of the cell-door, when
Edgar again addressed him.</p>

<p>“A word more, Colonel Hall, before you go. I have
another&mdash;a final request to make of you; should you accede
to it, you will confer upon me an inestimable boon.”</p>

<p>“Well, what may it be?”</p>

<p>“That you will allow my friend, War-Cloud, to visit me
here alone.”</p>

<p>“Captain, any thing within my power that will tend to alleviate
the rigorousness of your unpleasant position I will
willingly do&mdash;your request I grant.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! thanks!”</p>

<p>But a short interval elapsed after the departure of Colonel
Hall, when the door opened and War-Cloud entered. Edgar,
seizing the hand of his friend with warmth, and wringing it
cordially, led him to a seat beside his own, near the fire.</p>

<p>“I have a purpose, my friend, in thus sending for you,”
said Edgar. “You are aware of my helpless situation, unable
assist myself, or even her who is dearer to me than life itself;
for this reason have I sought you, as the only one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
whom I could unhesitatingly reveal my grave suspicions. I
also have a plan to unfold. Should it succeed, every thing
may again be righted; however, its undertaking entails many
hazards, perhaps death.”</p>

<p>“War-Cloud is always ready to aid his white brother.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, my faithful friend! To you, then, will I confide
my suspicion&mdash;in you do I place my last, my forlorn hope.
Draw near to me, that not a single word I speak may escape
you; for should this fail, then all is lost!”</p>

<p>Looking cautiously around to see that he could not be overheard,
Edgar commenced in a low, whispering tone to disclose
to the scout the plan of which he had spoken.</p>

<p>It was evident by the startled manner of War-Cloud, so
foreign to his natural stoicism, that he was a listener to a disclosure
that surpassed his most extravagant conceptions.</p>

<p>After a long conversation, they both arose. The sad, dejected
features of Edgar were now lighted up by a more hopeful
look, while on the countenance of War-Cloud there was an
expression of settled determination to be successful in this enterprise,
could human efforts effect such a result.</p>

<p>Moving toward the door, their eyes met, and in that gaze
each read the depth of friendship’s love. The two friends
clasped hands affectionately, and with a mutual farewell, the
next moment the Indian was gone.</p>

<p>The following morning anxious inquiries were made at the
fort concerning the whereabouts of War-Cloud, but he was
nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>He had quietly made his exit, unknown to any of the garrison;
but as these sudden and mysterious disappearances were
of no uncommon occurrence, they created no suspicion.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE HUNTED LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will again return to the fort. It was the day subsequent
to the arrest of Captain Sherwood and the disappearance
of Imogene Lear.</p>

<p>These unlooked-for events had furnished sufficient matter
for the gossips of the garrison; but now something else had
turned up which bid fair to overwhelm them.</p>

<p>In fact, the whole community was wild with excitement
about an apparition that a dozen or more affirmed to have
seen the previous night, pacing to and fro upon the parapets.</p>

<p>The soldiers became superstitious, and were collected here
and there in groups of three or four discussing the matter.</p>

<p>“I tell yer,” exclaimed a burly-looking fellow of one of
these crowds, “my eyes never cheated me yet, nor did they
last night. It wor he; I am sure of it!”</p>

<p>“But, Tompkins,” said another, “how could it have been
the cap’n? for I kept close guard at his cell-door all night,
and I am certain he <em>was</em> there, too.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it, if ye did,” chimed in Putney, the scout.
“Bill and I saw Sherwood on th’ parapets, as sartin as we
live. He wor all-fired pale, and wore a long, white, shaggy
cloak that looked awful enough to make one’s teeth chatter
and the hair to stand up straight.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s so, Put,” said Bill; “my legs shake just
a leetle now.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t take that post on the parapets for half the
world,” said a third man.</p>

<p>“’Cause you’re a scarish one,” growled the man opposite
him. “You’d ought to be a woman! I’d take it for nothing,
and if the ghost came near me he’d catch some cold lead for
his trouble.”</p>

<p>At this remark the crowd enjoyed a short laugh at the
“scared fellow’s” expense.</p>

<p>“This cap’n is a tricky one, comrades,” said Putney, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
ye’d all better look out for him in the futer, or he’ll fix some
of ye.”</p>

<p>“He’s the devil’s own!” added Bill.</p>

<p>Such was the talk concerning the ghost, or whatever it
might be, which they had seen. All who had witnessed the
phenomenon declared that it was Captain Sherwood; but
when the mystery was examined into, it was proved beyond
doubt that the captain had never left his cell once during
the night.</p>

<p>This was strange indeed, and no one could solve the enigma.
The captain began to be regarded with superstitious awe. He
heeded it not; there were more serious troubles that weighed
upon his mind.</p>

<p>It was the day on which his trial was to take place; and
as the hour for assembling the court approached, he began to
grow a little uneasy.</p>

<p>He had hitherto forgotten his own danger in his great sorrow
for the lost Imogene; but now, he awoke to a clear sense
of his own condition, and took a glance at the means that
were to extricate him from it.</p>

<p>The situation was indeed becoming alarming, for he was
well aware that should it in any way be proved that he was
the dreaded Iron Hand, his life would be worthless.</p>

<p>“What could he do?” he asked himself. “There is some
terrible mistake, and I fear me it will not be rectified until
too late!”</p>

<p>The moment at length arrived, and a court was detailed to
examine into his case. Upon its decision the fate of Edgar
Sherwood rested.</p>

<p>The assembly was quite large, consisting of the troops and
nearly all the civilians living in the vicinity. There were
three judges, clad in the martial vestments of their profession,
and maintaining a gravity worthy of the occasion, and becoming
their rank.</p>

<p>In the center was a venerable-looking man, whose whole exterior
bore the stamp of long-tried military habits. It was
Colonel Hall, who was the presiding justice of the court.
His associates were officers selected from the troops that garrisoned
the forts situated near Lake George.</p>

<p>Their demeanor was mild, but bore a grave reserve. Before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
these arbiters, Edgar Sherwood was ushered, under the
custody of two armed men.</p>

<p>A profound and awful silence succeeded his entrance,
while every eye was turned upon him. Then Colonel Hall
arising, spoke in the deep tones of one used to wield authority:</p>

<p>“Let the prisoner advance.”</p>

<p>Edgar proceeded with a firm step into the center of the
apartment. All was now anxiety and eager curiosity.</p>

<p>“Captain Sherwood, you are aware of the reason for this
tribunal, are you not?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be prudent,” said one of the judges,
“to inform the prisoner, that he is not bound to answer any
questions that will aid in his own condemnation.”</p>

<p>Edgar nodded, and Colonel Hall proceeded.</p>

<p>“You are charged, sir, with being an officer in his majesty’s
service, and of remaining in the Continental army in
disguise, for the purpose of acting as spy. What have you
to say to this?”</p>

<p>“That it is false!” exclaimed Edgar, in a tone that echoed
throughout the room.</p>

<p>“On what ground?”</p>

<p>“On the ground of my conduct heretofore.”</p>

<p>“This, undoubtedly, will have some weight, sir, but not
sufficient to counterbalance the testimony of witnesses. Have
you any other?”</p>

<p>Edgar paused, and seemed to commune with himself for
a moment, then answered with a look of dejection:</p>

<p>“No, none. I am deserted, and there is no one to speak
in my behalf. Let the case take its course&mdash;I must abide
your decision!”</p>

<p>“But, take time to reflect, sir; you must have something
more to offer in defense!” said the judge, quickly.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>At this, there was a frightful calmness in the manner of
the judge that seemed to appall the assemblage, and a murmur
of pity arose from some.</p>

<p>The silence lasted but for a moment, and then the witnesses
for the prosecution were ordered by the justice to
come forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>Hank Putney, the scout, was the first called.</p>

<p>“Do you know the prisoner?” asked the judge.</p>

<p>“I do,” returned the man, casting a careless glance at Edgar.</p>

<p>“How long have you known him?”</p>

<p>“Wal, let me see,” and he began to count his fingers;
“about&mdash;about&mdash;I reckon since Jenuary last.”</p>

<p>“During this time, have you ever noticed any thing suspicious
in his conduct that would lead you to believe him a
British spy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yer honor, somethin’ tarnation strong, I should say.”</p>

<p>“State it.”</p>

<p>“Wal, it wor th’ day afore yesterday that it happened.
Bill Hawkins and I wor sent out to s’arch for him, as ye
thought him either taken prisoner or shot, one or t’other;
but ’twas no such thing. About night, we come across a
band o’ these Tory and red-skin devils, and there, right in
th’ middle of ’em, wor our cap’n lookin’ as big as all yer
honors put together. He wor ev’dently their boss, for th’
devils wor all obeyin’ his orders, and trottin’ their legs off
to serve him.”</p>

<p>“Now, my man, you are aware that you are under oath?”</p>

<p>“Oh sartin, yer honor!”</p>

<p>“Are you positive that the prisoner before you and the
man you saw as a leader in the Tory camp, are one and the
same person?”</p>

<p>“Sartin, as my name is Hank Putney!”</p>

<p>“That will do.”</p>

<p>During the scout’s examination, the most intense interest prevailed
among the listeners, for it was understood that the
whole case rested mainly upon his testimony.</p>

<p>The accusation was so plain, the facts so limited, the proof
so obvious and the penalty so well established, that escape at
once seemed impossible.</p>

<p>The next witness was Putney’s companion, Bill Hawkins.
His testimony fully corroborated the scout’s in every respect.
He swore that he had seen Captain Sherwood in the midst of
the Tories, in command of the band known as the Tory
League.</p>

<p>“How do you know that he was in command, and that he
is their chief, Iron Hand?” asked the justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>“Heard the red-skins call him that name,” replied Bill.</p>

<p>“Was he, at this time, dressed in the uniform of the Continental
army?”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly. He had on huntin’ clothes like the Injuns.
He also wore a white, shaggy jacket, jist like the ghost
had last night.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Hawkins, what the ghost had, but the prisoner,”
said the justice, smiling. “You think he was clothed
in some garment made of white, shaggy fur?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yer honor, jist that.”</p>

<p>“Are there any more to testify in this case?” asked the
judge, glancing around the room.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, and then Putney, with the assistance
of a soldier, conducted a man to where the judges
were seated.</p>

<p>The stranger stopped and looked around him at the crowd
in wild dismay, until at length his eyes rested upon the prisoner,
when he gave a sudden start, but immediately recovered
himself.</p>

<p>However, all perceived this strange conduct on the part of
the new witness.</p>

<p>“Who is this you have here?” asked the judge.</p>

<p>“A prisoner we captur’d last night,” said Putney. “I calc’late
he’s one of th’ cap’n’s gang; he seems to know him.”</p>

<p>“My man, who are you?” said the judge, “and what do you
know about the prisoner?”</p>

<p>The stranger hung his head, but did not reply.</p>

<p>“Speak out, I conjure you!” cried the judge. “If you can
give any information in this matter, that will serve to clear up
the mystery, you shall be set at liberty.”</p>

<p>These words seemed to take effect upon him, and he appeared
to be more at ease.</p>

<p>“Do you know the prisoner?” again asked the judge, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Shall I have my liberty if I tell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I pledge you my word you shall.”</p>

<p>The man again held down his head, and after some moments,
ventured a sly glance at Edgar, who all the time seemed
to be regarding him with astonishment. Turning alternately
red and pale, apparently doing battle with himself, he
replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>“He’s the Tory chief, Iron Hand.”</p>

<p>“My God!” cried Edgar, starting to his feet with a savage
look. “What new enemy is this that dare utter lies so foul!
Merciful Heaven! is there no hope for me? Am I to be condemned
on the testimony of such villains?”</p>

<p>The stranger, with a look of fear depicted on every lineament
of his face, sprung behind the soldier.</p>

<p>“Keep him off! keep him off!” he screamed, “he’ll kill
me!”</p>

<p>For a short time the court-room was a scene of intense excitement,
and the judges arose to quell it.</p>

<p>“Remand your prisoner,” said the justice, to the officer who
was in charge of Edgar.</p>

<p>After a short consultation, the tribunal gave their verdict
against Edgar; and Colonel Hall, though his heart bled with
pity for the sad fate of his young friend, saw before him nothing
save his stern, uncompromising duty, and with trembling
hand, signed the death-warrant.</p>

<p>It briefly stated, that Edgar Sherwood had been detected
within the American lines, as a British spy in disguise, and
that thereby, according to the laws of war, he was liable to
suffer death, and that the court adjudged him to the penalty&mdash;sentencing
him to be executed by hanging, on the morning
of the following day.</p>

<p>The sentence of the court was communicated to the prisoner,
who received it with perfect resignation. The assembly
dispersed, and the judges retired to their own quarters with
unmoved exterior, and the consciousness of dispassionate integrity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was on the night after the trial, that a solitary traveler
might have been seen pursuing his way through a thick wood
situated about ten miles from the fort.</p>

<p>He was possessed of a powerful frame, being full six feet
in hight, and was clad in a hunter’s garb, consisting of shirt
and breeches made of skins.</p>

<p>In his girdle was placed an ugly-looking knife. His head
was adorned with a fur cap that hung down over the upper
part of his face, which gave him a somewhat singular appearance.
His hair was coarse, matted, and fiery red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p>As he proceeded on his way, his conduct to any observer
would have appeared decidedly suspicious. Every now and
then he would stop and listen attentively, and after casting a
searching glance about him to satisfy himself that no one was
following him, he would move on again.</p>

<p>The night was quite dark; an easterly wind, accompanied
by a chilling dampness, gave unerring notice of an approaching
storm. But the traveler, heeding it not, pushed on with
long strides, until at length he reached a mysterious-looking
hut standing at the foot of a hill and hemmed in with large
rocks and stunted oaks, whose foliage nearly concealed it from
view.</p>

<p>Here he stopped and gave a peculiar whistle. The door
was cautiously opened, and an armed man appeared at the
entrance.</p>

<p>“Hank!” said he, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Here, chief&mdash;open th’ door,” answered our friend, Hank
Putney, the scout.</p>

<p>The door was now thrown wide open to permit the traveler
to enter, and then closed and securely barred. The two
men uttered no words of greeting, but approaching one side
of the room, they sat down before a half-extinguished fire.</p>

<p>“You must be nearly chilled through, Hank,” said the
man. “Here, take some of this,” and he handed the scout a
flask.</p>

<p>Putney seized it with avidity, and placing it to his mouth,
took a deep draught.</p>

<p>“That’s right good old stuff,” said he, smacking his lips, as
he returned the bottle.</p>

<p>“Yes; this is the cordial our Whig neighbor had stored
away in his cellar,” said the Tory, chuckling.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” roared Putney; “he wor a clever old chap
to keep it for yer, chief.”</p>

<p>“Very accommodating indeed, I should say, for it was just
what my larder was sadly deficient in at the time,” and he indulged
in another suppressed laugh. “But come, tell me
what news you bring, Hank, for I am getting impatient.”</p>

<p>“Wal, it’s all right!” exclaimed the scout, bringing his fist
down on the palm of his hand. “He’s to be hanged to-morrow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>“What! have they convicted him then, of being Iron
Hand, and a British spy?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Capital! Give me your hand, worthy friend; you have
done me inestimable service,” and the Tory chieftain seized
the hand of his companion, with apparent cordiality.</p>

<p>“Yer writin’, chief, and my swearin’, are goin’ to stretch
his windpipe to-morrow mornin’,” continued Putney, with a
swaggering air.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! Well, that is a good joke, and well played,
Hank.”</p>

<p>The man’s small gray eyes sparkled with delight, and he
could hardly restrain himself, so great was his joy at this
piece of news.</p>

<p>“What fortune!” cried he; “just what I wanted. Here,
let us drink our fill&mdash;drink to the man who dies to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Here it goes then!” and Hank raised the bottle to his
lips. “That his journey in th’ world herearter may be a jolly
one!”</p>

<p>“Ay, my worthy fellow.”</p>

<p>As the fire, at intervals, brightened up and filled the room
with a red light, it cast the forms of the men in fantastic
shadows upon the wall.</p>

<p>Theirs were strange pictures&mdash;faces that portrayed the evil
side of human nature, and any one observing them while hate
and joy beamed thereon, would have involuntarily retreated
with a feeling of horror and disgust.</p>

<p>“How about the ghost, Hank, did you see it?” asked the
chief, with a roguish twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Ye devils, didn’t I though! Ha! ha! ha! ye played yer
part well, chief,” and Putney’s sides shook with laughter.</p>

<p>“The fools,” said Iron Hand. “You can frighten them all
to madness.”</p>

<p>“They reckon the cap’n’s a wizard, and ’ll bring ruin to
’em all.”</p>

<p>Iron Hand apparently did not hear this last remark, but
sat musing for some moments before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Did they condemn him on your testimony alone, Hank?”</p>

<p>“Mine and Bill Hawkins’, th’ chap I had with me th’
t’other day when I got th’ writin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>“He believed he swore to the truth?”</p>

<p>“Oh, o’ course!”</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d make it a bit stronger, howsomever, so I
brought down one of th’ League from th’ lower camp,” continued
Putney. “We made him believe that he wor my
prisoner. It wor Sandy Jim, and he’s a trump. He swore
that th’ prisoner was Iron Hand, and they let him go for
doin’ it.”</p>

<p>“You have done this job so far, Hank, in superb style;
you are my best man in the whole band. Now if you will
go back and aid in bringing our plan to a successful issue,
you shall be a rich man the day you return and prove to me
that this mortal enemy of mine is <em>dead</em>!”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” cried Putney. “I’d better start now, or th’
mornin’ will overtake me afore I get back to th’ fort,” and
with a parting farewell the two men separated.</p>

<span class="fs70">A SAVAGE FRIEND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> his interview with Hank Putney, Iron Hand set
out hastily to return to the rendezvous of his band. As he
hurried along, a smile of exultation overspread his countenance,
and he seemed to experience a secret feeling of joy
at the success of his deep-laid schemes.</p>

<p>He would occasionally indulge in a low, smothered laugh,
as some point of his plot more subtle than the rest would
recur to his mind. As he drew near to the cave, he found
his lieutenant at the entrance awaiting his approach.</p>

<p>“Well, lieutenant,” he exclaimed, addressing that officer,
“what news?”</p>

<p>“There is a new applicant, an Indian, sir, who is desirous
of joining the band.”</p>

<p>“A new recruit, eh, and an Indian too! This is strange
intelligence. What do you know of him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing further, than he says that he has been forced
to fly from beyond the lines of our enemy, the rebels. Indeed,
he seemed ardently desirous of being enrolled as a
member, and appears to bear a deep hatred toward his persecutors.”</p>

<p>“Is this all the knowledge you have of this fellow?”</p>

<p>“It is, sir.”</p>

<p>“You will send him to me then, immediately. But look
ye, lieutenant, should he be admitted to the League, you will
keep a vigilant watch on his movements.”</p>

<p>In a few moments afterward, Iron Hand was confronted
in his apartments by this new aspirant for predatory honors.</p>

<p>“What reasons bring you within the precincts of this
camp?” asked the Tory chieftain, as he bent upon his visitor
a cool, calculating gaze, as though he would read his innermost,
thoughts.</p>

<p>The Indian gave an explanation of his actions in a brief
and apparently satisfactory manner, for at its conclusion
Iron Hand exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Ah, I understand! you seek to become one of us in order
that you may find an occasion to revenge yourself?”</p>

<p>The Indian bowed in response.</p>

<p>“Then you have not sought in vain,” he continued; “for
we are about to attack a party of these rebels this very night,
and there you will have an ample opportunity to glut your
vengeance. You may report yourself to my lieutenant, who
will appoint you your station.”</p>

<p>As the Indian was about to depart, the Tory chief arose
quickly and approached him. Laying his hand on his shoulder,
he whispered:</p>

<p>“The reward is, for those who perform their duty faithfully
and do not neglect the interest of the band&mdash;pillage,
plunder, and wealth; but for a traitor&mdash;death!”</p>

<p>With this warning injunction, the newly-enrolled member
withdrew to prepare himself to take part in the coming
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">melée</i>  .</p>

<p>The different members of the band were in a state of bustle
and confusion, making preparations for the expected encounter.
This new enterprise was originated, not with the
usual design of pillaging, but for the purpose of attacking a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
small party of the enemy that were encamped midway between
the rendezvous of the League and the American lines,
and whom, on account of their proximity, it was deemed
expedient to remove, as the retreat of the band was liable
at any moment to be discovered by them.</p>

<p>At midnight they set out, and stealthily made their way
through the forest to the appointed place of attack. Their
foe, lulled into a feeling of security against attack, and little
dreaming of the presence of their deadly opponents, were
slumbering calmly.</p>

<p>At a preconcerted signal, out flashed the fire of a hundred
rifles, whose sharp crack went reverberating through the forest.</p>

<p>The attacked party, though completely taken by surprise,
fought bravely, and it was not until overwhelmed by superior
numbers that they slowly retreated, obstinately disputing every
foot of the ground.</p>

<p>Iron Hand watched every action of the strange Indian.</p>

<p>“See, with what a desperate vim this fellow strikes!” he
exclaimed, as he observed the Indian, heedless of danger,
throw himself recklessly upon the foe. “These other rascals
fight for plunder only, but he seems to battle for the hatred he
bears those rebels. This is my man&mdash;I will trust him,” he
murmured to himself; “he will be of valuable service to me
personally, do I but play well my part.”</p>

<p>At the command of the chief the pursuit was discontinued,
and the Tories, jubilant over their success, returned to the cave.
The quiet, calm demeanor of the strange Indian was quite a
striking contrast to the boisterous hilarity of his companions.</p>

<p>For a long time, the chief topic of conversation among the
members of the Tory League, was the fearless intrepidity of
their new comrade, who bore with unblushing indifference the
plaudits thus bestowed upon him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Imogene was awakened from the swoon into which she had
fallen after the termination of her interview with Iron Hand,
by the touch of some cold object.</p>

<p>As she raised herself slowly, she just succeeded in catching
a view of the figure of a man&mdash;an Indian, she knew by his
peculiar dress and the feathers that adorned his head&mdash;as he
glided swiftly from the apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>

<p>“<ins class="corr" id="tn78" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Who could this mystersous” changed to “Who could this mysterious”.">Who could this mysterious</ins>
visitor be?” she asked herself.</p>

<p>While arising from her reclining position she felt something
in her hand&mdash;it was a small piece of paper carelessly folded.</p>

<p>Opening it hastily, she with difficulty managed to decipher
from the rude, scrawling characters, the following significant
warning:</p>

<p>“Be watchful&mdash;a friend is near.”</p>

<p>Startled beyond measure by the contents of this anonymous
note, she was obliged to read it over repeatedly before she
could fairly realize its import.</p>

<p>In vain did she strive to give herself a satisfactory answer
as to who this unknown friend could be. Of such a person
sufficiently near to be of service to her, she knew not.</p>

<p>This inspiring news, vague though it was, revived her drooping
spirits. Pressing the billet fervently to her lips, she
placed it safely in her bosom, as though it were a gem of the
richest order.</p>

<p>The nearly extinct sparks of hope that lay dormant within
her breast, were again enkindled into a flame. Oh, how slowly
the hours, which to her seemed like years, glided by, as in a
state of feverish excitement, she anxiously awaited the arrival
of that promised assistance which came not.</p>

<p>Night was fast approaching; the evening of that day on
which the Tory chieftain had threatened to visit her, to receive
her final answer. Imogene sat musing, trying to picture
to herself the result of the terrible drama in which she
was acting so conspicuous, but yet so unwilling a part.</p>

<p>“Perhaps her new-found friend had been detected in his
gallant attempts to aid her, and was now suffering the penalty
of his generosity?” she thought.</p>

<p>While thus battling with her despondent feelings, she was
startled by hearing a gentle, catlike footstep on the floor.
Starting back half-affrighted, she beheld approaching her the
bearer of the mysterious note.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking his identity, for there was the
same peculiar dress, the same drooping war-locks. The
stranger advanced unhesitatingly, and as he entered into the
circle of light projected by the lamp, he threw off his disguise,
displaying to view the features of our old and trusty
friend, the faithful scout and patriot&mdash;War-Cloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p>For a moment Imogene was speechless.</p>

<p>“What! War-Cloud, you here, too!” she exclaimed, at
length, with a look of amazement.</p>

<p>She was about to speak further, but the scout raised his
finger with a significant gesture, warning her to remain quiet.
In answer to her anxious, inquiring look, he related in a few
hurried sentences the ruse he had practiced to enable him to
join the band, and how he accidentally learned of her presence
in the cave, through two Tories whose services he had
enlisted in a conspiracy he had formed for the abduction of
Iron Hand.</p>

<p>Imogene listened with wrapt attention. At the conclusion,
War-Cloud ordered her to be prepared to take her departure
at midnight, and then withdrew from the place as noiselessly
as he had entered.</p>

<p>Finding herself once more alone, Imogene, assuming an
attitude of prayer, poured out her soul in fervent thanksgiving
to Him who is the dispenser of all blessings.</p>

<p>The scout hastened back to his accomplices, of whom
he had spoken. It appears that immediately after joining
the League, he had noticed, with his natural keen perception,
a lurking spirit of dissatisfaction among several members of
the band, especially among two in particular.</p>

<p>By fomenting this turbulent spirit, and by promises of
sharing the bounteous reward offered for the capture of the
Tory chieftain, he had succeeded in bringing them over to
his views, at the same time without permitting them to obtain
even an inkling of his own real character.</p>

<p>With their plans thus well matured, the conspirators prepared
to put them into execution. Scarcely had the gun from
one of the neighboring frontier forts boomed the hour of
midnight, when they quietly arose, and stepping carefully
over the bodies of their sleeping companions, hurried to
the apartment of Imogene, who, fearful that every moment
would herald the advent of her detested suitor, Iron Hand,
was impatiently awaiting them.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn79" title="Transcriber’s Note—“The crisis of thier” changed to “The crisis of their”.">The crisis of their</ins>
undertaking had now arrived. To succeed
in leaving the place without causing any alarm, was
the only difficulty. As soon as they arrived at the mouth of
the cave, the sentinel stationed there hailed them, but with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the rapidity of lightning, War-Cloud sprung upon him, and
bearing him to the earth, firmly secured him.</p>

<p>The next moment Imogene, under the guidance of one of
the Tories, waving a hasty adieu, was gone. The scout and
his companion returned to their places among their slumbering
comrades, there to abide their time for the carrying out of
the rest of their plan.</p>

<p>As soon as he felt assured that Imogene had reached a safe
distance, the scout arose, and seizing his rifle, hastened to the
entrance of the rendezvous and discharged it. In an instant
every member of the band was on his feet, inquiring the cause
of the alarm.</p>

<p>Motioning his companion to keep close to him, War-Cloud,
uttering a loud cry, dashed into the apartment of the chief.
On hearing of his prisoner’s escape, Iron Hand, with an oath,
rushed into Imogene’s late place of confinement, only to find
that the bird had flown.</p>

<p>At this discovery, his frenzy knew no bounds. Uttering
a yell of rage, he bade War-Cloud and his companion to mount
and follow him. For a time the Tory’s chieftain’s usual cunning
seemed to have deserted him, for without seeming to
harbor the slightest suspicion of treachery, he ordered War-Cloud
to lead the way.</p>

<p>By the aid of the full autumnal moon, which ever and
anon shot, like a flying ghost, from one dark mass of vapor to
another, the trail of the fugitives was followed without difficulty.</p>

<p>It was necessary to overtake them before they should reach
the American lines, or else all was lost. On, on, they rode,
until they were almost within gunshot of the enemy, when
through an intervening space in the trees, Iron Hand spied
the fleeing forms of Imogene and her guide.</p>

<p>With a cry of exultation, the Tory, plunging his rowels
deep into the reeking sides of his steed, hurried in pursuit of
them, closely followed by his two companions. Imogene
heard the cry and looked back. She saw the Tory, and understood
the demoniac expression of his countenance. She
cast her eyes on the face of her companion, but upon it was
stamped a look of calm indifference.</p>

<p>Oh, for a few short moments, and she would again be free!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
How agonizing the thought that she was thus to be retaken!
and, too, within sight of the very camp-fires of her friends.
Once more did she sum up courage to steal another glance at
her pursuers. They were gaining upon her slowly but
surely.</p>

<p>In vain did she endeavor to accelerate the speed of her panting
animal. Another instant and she would again be within
the power of her detested captor! She could almost feel
his hot breath.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! fair rebel,” he exclaimed with a malignant laugh,
“captured at last!”</p>

<p>As he was on the point of laying hold of the bridle of Imogene’s
steed, he felt himself seized on either side by an iron
grasp, while a brace of pistols were presented at his head.</p>

<p>“Villains! What means this?” he cried, struggling to free
himself.</p>

<p>“That the tables are turned, chief, and you’re our prisoner,”
replied War-Cloud, raising his weapon in a threatening manner.</p>

<p>“Ah, treason! You&mdash;” but before he could complete his
sentence, he was dragged from his horse, disarmed, and firmly
bound.</p>

<p>The Tory made a desperate attempt to regain his liberty,
but, seeing how futile were his efforts, he sullenly resigned
himself to his fate.</p>

<p>In a short time the party reached the American outposts,
by whom they were conducted to the nearest frontier garrison,
to the commander of which, War-Cloud related his adventures,
and at the same time requested an escort to conduct his prisoner
to Fort Ann the next morning, which was readily granted.</p>

<p>After paying his companions that had assisted him in Iron
Hand’s capture, their portion of the reward, and exacting from
them a promise that they would engage no longer in their former
occupation, he dismissed them.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MASK REMOVED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> all in the garrison were bathed in quiet sleep, the
slumbers of Captain Sherwood were broken. After spending
a night of restlessness, he arose unrefreshed from the rude bed
where he had thrown himself, and walked to his prison window.</p>

<p>That brilliant luminary, the sun, like a ball of golden fire,
was just beginning to light up the eastern sky, giving promise
of another bright autumnal day. As Edgar looked out upon
the beautiful landscape painted by his Creator, a feeling of
awe which he had never before experienced, crept over him.</p>

<p>Every thing seemed to assume a more beautiful aspect, now
that he was soon to be parted from them forever; they began
to find a more precious place in his affections. It almost drove
him to despair to think that he was to die so soon. Ay! before
his course was run; to die a disgraceful&mdash;a traitor’s death!</p>

<p>“Oh! my God!” he exclaimed, dropping his head upon his
breast, “have mercy on me! If I must die, let me leave a
spotless name behind me!” unable any longer to control his
feelings, he gave way to his grief.</p>

<p>“My life is fated!” exclaimed he, at length. “A dark shadow
is cast before me; but I will show them that I can die like
a man!” and with these words Captain Sherwood prepared
himself to meet his doom like a hero.</p>

<p>He paced up and down his cell in deep abstraction. He
was thinking over his whole life, and it was one that had
experienced some vicissitudes. As his thoughts flew on, they
gradually came back to the present.</p>

<p>“What could have become of his beautiful Imogene?” he
asked himself for the hundredth time; “and again, his faithful
friend, War-Cloud&mdash;where was he all this time?”</p>

<p>After putting one suspicious circumstance with another, he
fully believed that some one was plotting against him. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
was not those men who had sworn his life away, but some profound
villain of whom they were but tools.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible,” he mused, “that Imogene may be
even at this moment in the power of this villain, whosoever
he may be!”</p>

<p>The remembrance of his frightful dream flashed across his
mind.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens!” he cried, “it was a presentiment&mdash;a
true one! Oh! oh! oh! she is dead&mdash;I shall go mad!” and
he staggered against the wall of his cell for support.</p>

<p>Just then the first beams of the morning sun stole in
through the window. This little circumstance, slight as
it may seem, reanimated the captain.</p>

<p>“It is an emblem of hope,” said he, recovering himself.</p>

<p>There is no more delusive phantom than hope; and it
seems to be the happy privilege of all to cull whatever
pleasures can be gathered from its indulgence. What we
think ought to be, we are fond to think will be.</p>

<p>Thus it was with our hero&mdash;he hoped that something
might happen before the appointed hour for his execution to
extricate him from his terrible dilemma.</p>

<p>Time, however, passed away. As the hours flew swiftly
by, every blow of the clock’s brass hammer sounded like a
death-knell upon the heart of the prisoner. Shortly there
was heard a great noise without&mdash;the creaking of timbers,
and the sound of the hammer and saw.</p>

<p>Edgar grew pale and approached the window. There it
was&mdash;that horrid machine of human vengeance&mdash;the gibbet,
glaring before his eyes, like an evil conscience harassing
the soul of a dying man.</p>

<p>The cold sweat burst from his burning brow. He had
felt before that it was hard for one so young as he to die
a death of infamy; but to spend his last moments alone and
unpitied; to know that all near him thought his fate merited;
that in a few hours he was to be conducted from the gloom
of his cell to the gallows, there to meet the gaze of a curious
multitude, as if he were a beast led to slaughter; and then
to take his departure of life, amidst the jeers and scoffs of
his fellow-creatures&mdash;this, indeed, was death&mdash;terrible death.</p>

<p>A short time previous to the execution, Edgar was aroused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
by hearing a slight tap on his cell door, and the next instant
a man was ushered into the apartment.</p>

<p>The stranger was a minister. His face was one of awful
gravity.</p>

<p>In stature he was above the size of ordinary men, though
his excessive leanness might contribute in deceiving as to his
hight; his countenance was sharp and unbending, and every
muscle seemed set in the most rigid compression; his eyes
were concealed beneath a pair of enormous green spectacles,
which gave these organs a very singular look.</p>

<p>His coat was black, and his breeches and stockings were
of the same hue, his shoes were without luster, and half
concealed beneath their huge, plated buckles.</p>

<p>“I have come,” said the divine, nodding to Edgar, “to
pray with you.”</p>

<p>Edgar bowed his head, and the two knelt down. The
good man’s sonorous voice filled the cell with solemn words.
Edgar’s heart beat with wild emotions, and he now felt that
every throb was but another herald warning him of death’s
near approach.</p>

<p>Upon rising from prayer, he ventured near the window
once more and cast another glance at the gallows. A large
crowd was collected about it, eagerly waiting to witness the
death of Iron Hand, the British spy.</p>

<p>“These are heartless people!” said the minister, looking
over Edgar’s shoulder. “But be firm, my poor brother; there
is mercy for all before the great Throne of Justice.”</p>

<p>The multitude did not have long to wait. A few moments
prior to the expiration of the appointed hour, the prisoner,
guarded by several soldiers, came forth.</p>

<p>He was slightly pale, but stood erect, and marched forward
with a firm, military step. Approaching the scaffold, they
went slowly up the stairs to the platform.</p>

<p>The vast concourse of people were now as one, silent and
motionless. Nothing broke the stillness save the hanging rope,
which trembled and squeaked as a slight wind swayed it back
and forth.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the garrison were drawn up in a square
around the gallows, while outside of the guard was the populace.
Every elevated place was thronged with spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<p>Edgar advanced to the front of the platform to say a few
parting words, but the reports of several rifles in quick succession
prevented him. All turned simultaneously to look
from whence they came.</p>

<p>A horseman was seen in the distance approaching with flying
speed. On, on, he comes&mdash;now for a moment lost to
view as he plunges through some grove of trees, then quickly
emerges again, leaping forth on the open ground, growing
larger and larger, until at length he is near enough to be recognized
by all, when the cry of “War-Cloud! War-Cloud!”
rung upon the air.</p>

<p>The steed, foaming and gray with dust, with nostrils dilated
and eyes flashing fire, dashed by the guard and halted before
the scaffold. The scout leaped from the faithful charger, and
springing up the steps seized the executioner’s arm.</p>

<p>“Hold, my pale-face brother!” he cried.</p>

<p>At these words the spectators were struck with amazement,
and gazed about them for an explanation. At the expiration
of a few moments, four more horsemen arrived. They were
dragoons, and with them rode a man lashed to his horse, and
behind him, on a white steed, came a female.</p>

<p>The party halted, and awaited War-Cloud’s orders. As
Edgar caught sight of the unknown lady, he gave a sudden
start, and the color faded from his cheek.</p>

<p>“Can it be she?” he murmured to himself.</p>

<p>He had surmised correctly; it was in truth Imogene Lear.
As she approached him their eyes met. The recognition was
mutual. The next instant, shedding tears of joy, they were
clasped in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>The scout now advanced, and untied the cords that bound
the horseman, and ordered him to alight. The prisoner
obeyed; he offered no resistance. His head was bowed down
upon his breast, and he appeared to be completely crushed in
spirit.</p>

<p>With the aid of two of the dragoons, War-Cloud assisted
him up on the scaffold, and then quickly removed the muffler
that had heretofore concealed the prisoner’s face from view.</p>

<p>“My God!” exclaimed Edgar, starting back. “That countenance&mdash;it
is he&mdash;it is Maurice, <em>my brother</em>!” and reeling,
would have fallen, had he not been supported by the scout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<p>On beholding the face thus exposed to their gaze, the spectators
stood aghast.</p>

<p><em>The features were an exact counterpart in every respect, of those
of Edgar Sherwood.</em></p>

<p>That these two men were brothers could not now be
doubted, and all seemed to comprehend, in an instant, the
mistake that had been made. The great mystery was at
length solved. It was, indeed, a&mdash;<span class="smcap">Double Face</span>.</p>

<p>Imogene now related the cause of her sudden and mysterious
disappearance, the treachery of Hank Putney and his implication
in the conspiracy for her abduction, and lastly confirmed
the statement, that the prisoner before them was the
dreaded Iron Hand, by his own confession during their interview
in the cave of the Tory League.</p>

<p>At the conclusion, Colonel Hall arose, and congratulated
the multitude on the happy termination of what had almost
succeeded in becoming a tragedy.</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished, when a low murmur of applause
ran through the assembly, which at length broke forth into
lusty cheers. All now turned toward the spot where Hank
Putney had been seen only a few moments before, among the
most clamorous for Captain Sherwood’s execution; but the
traitor, seeing the turn events were taking, had fled.</p>

<p>Although Edgar Sherwood had been condemned to suffer
death for his brother’s crimes, nevertheless how little was
known concerning the deep plot that had been laid to bring
about this dreadful mistake.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE UNNATURAL BROTHER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Maurice Sherwood</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i> Iron Hand, who had committed
so many villainous deeds in the past few years, and whose
name had become such a terror to every household, now stood
before them, pale and trembling.</p>

<p>Five years previous he had sworn vengeance against his
brother, who had never seen him during all this time to know
him, and who had believed him to be hundreds of miles away.
How near this threat had come to being carried out, the reader
already knows.</p>

<p>The desperado’s plans had been skillfully concocted, but a
just Providence could not look down upon and sanction the
success of a scheme so wicked; thus it was this villain had
been baffled in the very last act of his drama.</p>

<p>It had been his design to kill his brother secretly, and this
he had attempted during the battle related in one of the foregoing
chapters. For could he but remove Edgar from his
path, the immense estate which he owned in England would,
by the conditions of the father’s will, be inherited by himself.</p>

<p>However, after this should be accomplished, there was still
another object he had in view, and that was to obtain the
hand of Imogene Lear. It was she who had first innocently
caused the feud between the two brothers.</p>

<p>Maurice had sought her hand when both families resided
in England, but had been rejected and his brother accepted.
Upon seeing himself thus supplanted by his brother Edgar
in the affections of one whom he loved so passionately, his
rage was unbounded, and the anger that rankled in his heart
soon grew into virulent hatred, which was appeased only by
deeds of bloodshed.</p>

<p>He had intended, therefore, after the death of Edgar
to stigmatize him by casting upon his memory the odious
name of Iron Hand, which he himself possessed, and thus he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
hoped that when his brother should have been proved a British
spy and a murderer, that Imogene would renounce him.</p>

<p>He, in the mean time, would return to England, and after
having possessed himself of the inheritance, would again sue
for her hand.</p>

<p>Seeing how signally he had failed in both his attempt to
slay Captain Sherwood and in his effort to decoy Imogene to
his power by the aid of the forged letter which he had pretended
to be from her betrothed, Iron Hand determined to
secure her by force, and for that purpose had selected three
of his band, together with Hank Putney, who at the time was
serving him in the American garrison in the capacity of a
spy, as their leader, while he himself assumed the role of the
old man to assist in the undertaking.</p>

<p>It was while in this guise that he met Imogene on her return
to her father’s house, and whispered those words that
caused her to start back with such a look of horror and disgust.
He intimated to her his knowledge of Maurice Sherwood’s
whereabouts, and had proposed, as Edgar was then
accused of being a traitor, to restore amicable relations between
them.</p>

<p>Had she accepted his offer, he would have then and there
revealed to her his true character, and afterward trusted to
his natural tact for a reconciliation; but her answer taught
him how thoroughly he was detested, and from that moment
he desperately resolved to carry out his plans to the bitter
end.</p>

<p>When Edgar Sherwood had first been arrested, he had
half-suspected that it was his twin-brother Maurice who was
<ins class="corr" id="tn88" title="Transcriber’s Note—“at the bottom of the mysttery” changed to “at the bottom of the mystery”.">at the bottom of the mystery</ins>,
and it was to ascertain if his
suspicions were correct that he had dispatched his faithful
friend, War-Cloud, on his secret mission, which was so fruitful
in its results, and which had succeeded in saving from an ignominious
death one of America’s noblest sons, and in bringing
to justice the guilty.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE END OF THE TRANSGRESSOR IS HARD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the day following that which was to have witnessed
the execution of Captain Sherwood.</p>

<p>The morning which had first given promise of a beautiful
day turned out to be quite disagreeable, and during the afternoon
there was a succession of showers. The night was
dark and stormy, and vast clouds covered the heavens.</p>

<p>Occasionally, by the assistance of a flash of lightning, Iron
Hand might have been seen sitting in his cell&mdash;the one in
which his brother had been confined. His head was bowed
down upon his knees, and his whole appearance was that of
despair.</p>

<p>He finally arose, and approaching the grated window,
looked out into the darkness. The storm was turning every
thing into wild disorder. He seemed to experience a feeling
of consolation in seeing nature partake of the tumult that
reigned within his own heart.</p>

<p>The thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger
in his thoughts; he howled as the hurricane howled, and his
voice was lost in the great voice of Nature, who also seemed
to groan with despair.</p>

<p>This desperate man’s imagination was a fertile one, and he
soon recovered from his dejection and began to put his brains
to work in order to concoct some plan of escape. He reclined
upon his pallet of straw and thought earnestly.</p>

<p>The hours passed on until the night was well advanced.</p>

<p>At length his attention was attracted by hearing a gentle
tap at his window. He started quickly to his feet and listened.
Again was the noise repeated.</p>

<p>As he was hurrying across the room to ascertain its cause,
there burst forth a peal of thunder accompanied by a flash
of lightning, and by the aid of its sickly glare he saw the face
of a man appear behind the bars.</p>

<p>He sprung to the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p>“Hank!”</p>

<p>“Yes, chief!” said Hank Putney, for it was he; “but be
quiet! be quiet! I must have time to file through these
bars. Only take care that I am not seen through th’ gratin’
of th’ door.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is all secure; it is too dark for the sentinel to
see you, and I will stand with my back against the door.”</p>

<p>“Be ready at the first signal.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my trusty fellow; but make haste;” and he retreated
to the door, where he placed himself in such a position that
no person without the cell could possibly obtain a view of
the window.</p>

<p>Amidst the moaning of the storm Iron Hand could hear the
grinding of the file upon the bars, and by the light of every
flash he perceived the form of Hank Putney.</p>

<p>An hour was spent in breathless suspense; the cold sweat
stood upon his brow, and his heart beat quick at every movement
he heard in the corridor.</p>

<p>There are hours which seem a year.</p>

<p>At the expiration of an hour, Hank tapped again. Iron
Hand hastened to the window. Two of the huge iron bars
were removed, forming an opening large enough for a man to
pass through.</p>

<p>“Are ye ready?” asked Hank, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then wait till I slide down the rope, ’cause it won’t hold
us both; and I’ll get off the walls, and ye can jine me in the
woods jist on top of the hill.”</p>

<p>With these parting words, Putney slid down the rope out
of Iron Hand’s sight.</p>

<p>When the Tory thought a sufficient time had elapsed for
his faithful ally to have reached a place of safety, he passed
through the window, and seizing the dangling rope, began to
descend slowly. Notwithstanding the weight of his body,
the blast of the hurricane made him wave in the air.</p>

<p>The heavy tramp of approaching footsteps was borne to
his ears by the wind. He stopped and listened. The patrol
were passing along beneath him, laughing and talking. It
was a terrible moment for the fugitive as he remained there
suspended, motionless and breathless; but the soldiers soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
passed, and the noise of their retreating footsteps, together
with the murmur of their voices, soon died away.</p>

<p>Breathing a sigh of relief, he continued his descent. He
shortly found himself standing upon one of the parapets of
the fort. Iron Hand knew perfectly well where he was;
for he had been upon this same wall before and reconnoitered;
it was the time when those who had seen him had taken
him for the captain’s ghost.</p>

<p>The wall was high from the outside, and he knew it would
be madness to leap off. But about thirty yards from where
he was standing, there was an angle where little steps were
cut into the rocks leading to the ground. Could he but
reach this place without being perceived, he would be safe.</p>

<p>The storm had increased, the flashes succeeded each other
more rapidly, and the thunder growled fiercely. Iron Hand
crawled cautiously on his hands and knees, and was near
the angle, when there came a bright flash which lighted up
the whole heavens.</p>

<p>The sentinel stationed on the wall opposite caught sight
of him and fired. The Tory chieftain sprung to his feet, and
clasping his hands to his side, he staggered a moment, then
uttering a deep groan, fell to the ground within the fort.
The report of the sentinel’s rifle aroused the whole garrison,
who hastily seized their arms, thinking an attack had been
made for the rescue of Iron Hand.</p>

<p>A file of soldiers hastened to the threatened spot, where
they found the bloody and apparently lifeless form of the
Tory. Two stalwart soldiers lifted him and bore him to the
guard-house. The ball had entered his side and the blood
was running freely from the wound.</p>

<p>“He’s not dead; run for the surgeon!” said one, feeling
his pulse.</p>

<p>An eager crowd was soon gathered around, and by the dim
light afforded by one or two torches the scene presented a
weird appearance. In a few moments the surgeon was at
the side of the wounded man, and applying some restoratives
he soon became conscious again. Opening his eyes
with a wild stare, Iron Hand glanced around upon the assembly.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>

<p>“Here, in the fort,” said the surgeon.</p>

<p>Raising himself, he looked around him again, and then
uttering a wild cry, fell backward.</p>

<p>“What is this strange feeling that comes over me?” he
asked in a husky whisper, pressing his hands on his bloody
wound. “Am I dying?”</p>

<p>“I fear you are,” responded the surgeon.</p>

<p>“What! dying did you say?” he repeated, in a hollow
voice. “My God! must I die?”</p>

<p>“Yes; make your peace with your Maker, for you have
but an hour or so longer to live.”</p>

<p>A shudder shook the man’s whole frame, and his eyes
glared wildly.</p>

<p>“Where is the man that shot me?” he shrieked, pulling
a dirk from his belt.</p>

<p>“No, no, my man,” said the surgeon; “you should think
of something else now instead of vengeance.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;” the rest of his sentence was inaudible.</p>

<p>Just then the crowd parted to make way for two newcomers,
who were drenched with rain. They were Edgar
Sherwood and Imogene Lear.</p>

<p>“Maurice!” said Edgar in a low tone, approaching the
dying man.</p>

<p>“Great God!” said Iron Hand. “It is he! it is he! I
know that voice! Oh! oh! he will kill me, and I can not
move. Let me escape&mdash;hide me, for I shot him once. I
have been his evil shadow all his life!” and he struggled violently
to raise himself.</p>

<p>“He raves,” said the surgeon; “we must get that dagger
from him, or he may do some mischief.”</p>

<p>But just then the madman dropped the weapon upon the
floor.</p>

<p>His face was distorted with agony; his glassy eyes were
fixed apparently on some distant object.</p>

<p>“Look! look!” he whispered, pointing to a window at the
further end of the room.</p>

<p>All eyes were quickly turned toward the place indicated,
but there was nothing strange there.</p>

<p>“It is the old Whig! look! look! see that gaping wound&mdash;the
gash upon his temple! It was I that did it&mdash;I killed him!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Hark! hear how he cries for vengeance! See! he comes this
way! Oh, horror, horror! he stretches out his hands to seize
me&mdash;I feel their icy grasp! Oh God! I am dy&mdash;dying!” and
with a piercing shriek, he fell back upon his couch.</p>

<p>The assemblage gazed upon the expiring man in gloomy
silence. It was, indeed, a horrible sight to see him writhing
in such agony. Edgar and Imogene, their hearts bowed
down with sorrow, turned away; they could not endure the
sight.</p>

<p>It lasted, however, but a few moments more. The impress
of the hand of Death was on his pallid brow, and straightening
out his stiffening limbs, he gave one long, struggling gasp,
then all was over.</p>

<p>The surgeon sprung to his side, but the Tory chieftain was&mdash;<em>dead</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII"><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER XIII</span>.<br />
<span class="fs70">SMILES THROUGH TEARS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> one bright spring morning about six months after the
events previously related, the woods in the vicinity of Fort
Ann were filled with a brilliant assemblage of Continental
officers and their ladies, who were all in a merry mood, for
there was a wedding to take place between Captain Edgar
Sherwood and Imogene Lear.</p>

<p>The whole week had been occupied in preparing the grove
for this important occasion. Seats had been erected for the
guests, and under the shade of a giant oak a picturesque bower
twined with wild roses and luxuriant foliage, had been constructed
for the reception of the clergyman. The regimental
band also had found a place near at hand made for their benefit.</p>

<p>In a word, every thing had been arranged with the idea of
making the captain’s wedding a grand affair. It was not to
be in a gloomy church, or a fashionable drawing-room crowded
to suffocation, but in a grand old forest, under the bright light
of heaven.</p>

<p>The troops of the garrison were drawn up in a long line on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
either side of the walk leading to the bower, and, stationed
here and there along the way, were young girls dressed in
white, and holding baskets of flowers to strew before the bride
and groom as they passed.</p>

<p>Every thing was in readiness. The shrill notes of a bugle
heralded the approach of Edgar and Imogene; and presently
they entered the grove attended by the hymeneal retinue.
While the little party moved slowly forward toward the bower,
the surrounding woods resounded with the melodious and
thrilling notes of the band, and the birds sung their sweetest.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful sight to behold these two young lovers
approaching the altar to pledge their hearts to each other, and
to take those mutual vows of fidelity before God and man.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the bower, an old man came forward
with feeble steps, and taking the hand of each he placed them
together and murmured:</p>

<p>“My children, I bless you; may Heaven look down upon
and prosper this union!”</p>

<p>It was Thomas Lear, Imogene’s father.</p>

<p>The reader must not be surprised at this, for a revolution
had taken place in the old man’s politics since the opening of
our story. Being naturally an enthusiastic admirer of justice
and a lover of personal and political freedom, he had been, at
length, aroused by the feeling of liberty that was everywhere
prevalent, and was now a stanch believer in the war for independence.</p>

<p>This radical change had not come about spontaneously but
gradually, growing out of observation. He had perceived
the injustice of the mother country toward her most promising
child, and finally became one of the most devoted adherents
to the cause of the Colonies.</p>

<p>The minister now performed the marriage ceremony, and our
hero and heroine were pronounced man and wife. In an instant,
the dreadful Past, with all its woes and sorrows, was buried in
the deepest recesses of oblivion, leaving the happy Present,
as it were, like an insurmountable barrier between it and the
bright and promising Future, which dawned fair and beautiful
upon the horizon of their happiness.</p>

<p>Their more intimate friends&mdash;among whom were Colonel
Hall and War-Cloud&mdash;pressed around the happy couple to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
congratulate them, while the soldiers gave three hearty cheers
for their brave captain and his lady, making the woods, hills,
and valleys ring with the echo of a thousand voices.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There now remains for us to add but a short epilogue and
we will have finished. Captain Sherwood fought bravely
during the remainder of the Revolution, and when the war
was ended, and our country had just entered upon its newborn
career of unrivaled greatness, he and Imogene took up
their residence in the city of the Manhattans, where they spent
many quiet and peaceful days while floating down the stream
of life to the harbor of old age.</p>

<p>War-Cloud frequently paid them visits, bringing with him
pretty and costly furs for the “little ones,” denoting that he
had again taken to hunting the beast instead of Tories.</p>

<p>Hank Putney never made his appearance at the fort again;
but we believe he became the chief of the Tory League after
the death of Iron Hand, and during some quarrel between him
and his ruffians he was killed.</p>

<p>The band soon after was exterminated, and nothing now
remains of their former power, save the history of their many
villainous deeds, which is written in blood!</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
